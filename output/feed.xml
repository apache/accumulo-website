        <title>Apache Accumulo 2.1.1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Accumulo 2.1.1 is a patch release of the 2.1.0 LTM line. It contains
many bug fixes and minor enhancements, including a critical fix. This version
supersedes 2.1.0. Users upgrading to 2.1 should upgrade directly to this
version instead of 2.1.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Included here are some highlights of the most interesting bugs and features
fixed in 2.1.1. Several trivial bugs were also fixed that related to the
presentation of information on the monitor, or to avoid spammy/excessive
logging, but are too numerous to list here. For the full set of bug fixes,
please see the commit history or issue tracker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This 2.1 release also includes any applicable bug fixes and improvements
that occurred in 1.10.3 and earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;critical-fixes&quot;&gt;Critical Fixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-34340&quot;&gt;CVE-2023-34340&lt;/a&gt; Fixed a critical issue that improperly allowed a user under
some conditions to authenticate to Accumulo using an invalid password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notable-improvements&quot;&gt;Notable Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements that add capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3180&quot;&gt;#3180&lt;/a&gt; Enable users to provide per-volume Hadoop Filesystem
configuration overrides via the Accumulo configuration. Hadoop Filesystem
objects are configured by the standard Hadoop mechanisms (default
configuration, core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, etc.), but these configuration
files don’t allow for the same property to be specified with different values
for different namespaces. This change allows users to specify different
property values for different Accumulo volumes, which will be applied to the
Hadoop Filesystem object created for each Accumulo volume&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1169&quot;&gt;#1169&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3142&quot;&gt;#3142&lt;/a&gt; Add configuration option for users to select
how the last location field is used, so users have better control over
initial assignments on restarts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3400&quot;&gt;#3400&lt;/a&gt; Inject environment injected into ContextClassLoaderFactory SPI
so implementations can read and make use of Accumulo’s own configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements that affect performance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3175&quot;&gt;#3175&lt;/a&gt; Reset number of locks in SynchronousLoadingBlockCache from
2017 back to 5003, the value that it was in 1.10. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3226&quot;&gt;#3226&lt;/a&gt; Also,
modified the lock to be fair, which allows the different scan threads in the
server to make progress in a more fair manner when they need to load a block
into the cache&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3077&quot;&gt;#3077&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3079&quot;&gt;#3079&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3083&quot;&gt;#3083&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3123&quot;&gt;#3123&lt;/a&gt; Avoid filling
OS page cache by calling &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setDropBehind&lt;/code&gt; on the FS data stream when
performing likely one-time file accesses, as with WAL and compaction input
and output files. This should allow files that might benefit more from
caching to stay in the cache longer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3083&quot;&gt;#3083&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3123&quot;&gt;#3123&lt;/a&gt;
introduces new properties, table.compaction.major.output.drop.cache and
table.compaction.minor.output.drop.cache, for dropping pages from the OS page
cache for compaction output files. These changes will only have an impact on
HDFS FileSystem implementations and operating systems that support the
underlying OS system call. See associated issue, &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-16864&quot;&gt;HDFS-16864&lt;/a&gt;, that will
improve the underlying implementation when resolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Improvements that help with administration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3445&quot;&gt;#3445&lt;/a&gt; Add emergency maintenance utility to edit properties in
ZooKeeper while the Accumulo cluster is shut down&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3118&quot;&gt;#3118&lt;/a&gt; Added option to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;admin zoo-info-viewer&lt;/code&gt; command to dump
the ACLs on ZooKeeper nodes. This information can be used to fix znodes with
incorrect ACLs during the upgrade process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other notable changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3126&quot;&gt;#3126&lt;/a&gt; Remove unintentionally bundled htrace4 from our packaging;
users will need to provide that for themselves if they require it on their
classpath&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3436&quot;&gt;#3436&lt;/a&gt; Deprecate gc.trash.ignore property. The trash can be
customized within Hadoop if one wishes to ignore it, or configure it to be
ignored for only specific files (and this has been tested with recent
versions of Hadoop); In version 3.0, this property will be removed, and it
will no longer be possible to ignore the trash by changing this property&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notable-bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Notable Bug Fixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3134&quot;&gt;#3134&lt;/a&gt; Fixed Thrift issues due to incorrect setting of maxMessageSize&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3144&quot;&gt;#3144&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3150&quot;&gt;#3150&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3164&quot;&gt;#3164&lt;/a&gt; Fixed bugs in ScanServer that
prevented a tablet from being scanned when some transient failures occurred&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3346&quot;&gt;#3346&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3366&quot;&gt;#3366&lt;/a&gt; Fixed tablet metadata verification task so it
doesn’t unintentionally cause the server to halt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3479&quot;&gt;#3479&lt;/a&gt; Fixed issue preventing servers from shutting down because they
were still receiving assignments&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/3492&quot;&gt;#3492&lt;/a&gt; Fixed a bug where bulk imports could cause compactions to hang&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Apache Accumulo 2.1.0</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Accumulo 2.1.0 brings many new features and updates since 1.10 and 2.0. The 2.1 release
series is an LTM series, and as such, is expected to receive stability-improving bugfixes, as
needed. This makes this series suitable for production environments where stability is preferable
over new features that might appear in subsequent non-LTM releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release has received more than 1200 commits from over 50 contributors, including numerous
bugfixes, updates, and features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimum-requirements&quot;&gt;Minimum Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This version of Accumulo requires at least Java 11 to run. Various Java 11 versions from different
distributors were used throughout its testing and development, so we expect it to work with any
standard OpenJDK-based Java distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least Hadoop 3 is required, though it is recommended to use a more recent version. Version 3.3
was used extensively during testing, but we have no specific knowledge that an earlier version of
Hadoop 3 will not work. Whichever major/minor version you use, it is recommended to use the latest
bugfix/patch version available. By default, our POM depends on 3.3.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During much of this release’s development, ZooKeeper 3.5 was used as a minimum. However, that
version reach its end-of-life during development, and we do not recommend using end-of-life versions
of ZooKeeper. The latest bugfix version of 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 should also work fine. By default, our
POM depends on 3.8.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;binary-incompatibility&quot;&gt;Binary Incompatibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release is known to be incompatible with prior versions of the client libraries. That is, the
2.0.0 or 2.0.1 version of the client libraries will not be able to communicate with a 2.1.0 or later
installation of Accumulo, nor will the 2.1.0 or later version of the client libraries communicate
with a 2.0.1 or earlier installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-new-features&quot;&gt;Major New Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overhaul-of-table-compactions&quot;&gt;Overhaul of Table Compactions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Significant changes were made to how Accumulo compacts files in this release. See
&lt;a href=&quot;/docs/2.x/administration/compaction&quot;&gt;compaction &lt;/a&gt; for details, below are some highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple concurrent compactions per tablet on disjoint files is now supported.  Previously only a
single compaction could run on a tablet.  This allows tablets that are running long compactions
on large files to concurrently compact new smaller files that arrive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple compaction thread pools per tablet server are now supported. Previously only a single
thread pool existed within a tablet server for compactions.  With a single thread pool, if all
threads are working on long compactions it can starve quick compactions.  Now compactions with
little data can be processed by dedicated thread pools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accumulo’s default algorithm for selecting files to compact was modified to select the smallest
set of files that meet the compaction ratio criteria instead of the largest set.  This change
makes tablets more aggressive about reducing their number files while still doing logarithmic
compaction work. This change also enables efficiently compacting new small files that arrive
during a long running compaction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having dedicated compaction threads pools for tables is now supported through configuration.  The
default configuration for Accumulo sets up dedicated thread pools for compacting the Accumulo
metadata table.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merging minor compactions were dropped.  These were added to Accumulo to address the problem of
new files arriving while a long running compaction was running.  Merging minor compactions could
cause O(N^2) compaction work. The new compaction changes in this release can satisfy this use
case while doing a logarithmic amount of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CompactionStrategy was deprecated in favor of new public APIs. CompactionStrategy was never public
API as it used internal types and one of these types &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FileRef&lt;/code&gt; was removed in 2.1. Users who have
written a CompactionStrategy can replace &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FileRef&lt;/code&gt; with its replacement internal type
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;StoredTabletFile&lt;/code&gt; but this is not recommended. Since it is very likely that CompactionStrategy will
be removed in a future release, any work put into rewriting a CompactionStrategy will be lost. It is
recommended that users implement CompactionSelector, CompactionConfigurer, and CompactionPlanner
instead.  The new compaction changes in 2.1 introduce new algorithms for optimally scheduling
compactions across multiple thread pools, configuring a deprecated compaction strategy may result is
missing out on the benefits of these new algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.javadoc.io/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo-tserver/2.1.2/org/apache/accumulo/tserver/compaction/CompactionStrategy.html&quot;&gt;javadoc&lt;/a&gt; for more
information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub tickets related to these changes: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/564&quot;&gt;#564&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1605&quot;&gt;#1605&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1609&quot;&gt;#1609&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1649&quot;&gt;#1649&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;external-compactions-experimental&quot;&gt;External Compactions (experimental)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature includes two new optional server components, CompactionCoordinator and Compactor, that
enables the user to run major compactions outside of the TabletServer. See &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/2.x/getting-started/design&quot;&gt;design &lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/2.x/administration/compaction&quot;&gt;compaction &lt;/a&gt;, and the External Compaction &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2021/07/08/external-compactions.html&quot;&gt;blog
post&lt;/a&gt; for more information. This work was completed over many tickets, see the GitHub
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/projects/20&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; for the related issues. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2096&quot;&gt;#2096&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scan-servers-experimental&quot;&gt;Scan Servers (experimental)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature includes a new optional server component, Scan Server, that enables the user to run
scans outside of the TabletServer. See &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/2.x/getting-started/design&quot;&gt;design &lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2411&quot;&gt;#2411&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2665&quot;&gt;#2665&lt;/a&gt; for more information. Importantly, users can utilize this
feature to avoid bogging down the TabletServer with long-running scans, slow iterators, etc.,
provided they are willing to tolerate eventual consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-per-table-on-disk-encryption-experimental&quot;&gt;New Per-Table On-Disk Encryption (experimental)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-disk encryption can now be configured on a per table basis as well as for the entire instance
(all tables). See &lt;a href=&quot;/docs/2.x/security/on-disk-encryption&quot;&gt;on-disk-encryption &lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-jshell-entry-point&quot;&gt;New jshell entry point&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created new “jshell” convenience entry point. Run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bin/accumulo jshell&lt;/code&gt; to start up jshell,
preloaded with Accumulo classes imported and with an instance of AccumuloClient already created for
you to connect to Accumulo (assuming you have a client properties file on the class path)  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1870&quot;&gt;#1870&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1910&quot;&gt;#1910&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-improvements&quot;&gt;Major Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fixed-gc-metadata-hotspots&quot;&gt;Fixed GC Metadata hotspots&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to this release, Accumulo stored GC file candidates in the metadata table using rows of the
form &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~del&amp;lt;URI&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This row schema lead to uneven load on the metadata table and metadata tablets
that were eventually never used. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1043&quot;&gt;#1043&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1344&quot;&gt;#1344&lt;/a&gt;, the row format was changed to
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~del&amp;lt;hash(URI)&amp;gt;&amp;lt;URI&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; resulting in even load on the metadata table and even data spread in the
tablets. After upgrading, there may still be splits in the metadata table using the old row format.
These splits can be merged away as shown in the example below which starts off with splits generated
from the old and new row schema. The old splits with the prefix &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~delhdfs&lt;/code&gt; are merged away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@uno&amp;gt; getsplits -t accumulo.metadata

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;master-renamed-to-manager&quot;&gt;Master Renamed to Manager&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use more inclusive language in our code, the Accumulo team has renamed all references to
the word “master” to “manager” (with the exception of deprecated classes and packages retained for
compatibility). This change includes the master server process, configuration properties with master
in the name, utilities with master in the name, and packages/classes in the code base. Where these
changes affect the public API, the deprecated “master” name will still be supported until Accumulo
3.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;
  One particular change to be aware of is that certain state for the manager process is stored in
  ZooKeeper, previously in under a directory named &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;masters&lt;/code&gt;. This directory has been renamed to
  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;managers&lt;/code&gt;, and the upgrade will happen automatically if you launch Accumulo using the provided
  scripts. However, if you do not use the built in scripts (e.g., accumulo-cluster or
  accumulo-service), then you will need to perform a one-time upgrade of the ZooKeeper state by
  executing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RenameMasterDirInZK&lt;/code&gt; utility:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  ${ACCUMULO_HOME}/bin/accumulo org.apache.accumulo.manager.upgrade.RenameMasterDirInZK
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other specific examples of these changes include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All configuration properties starting with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master.&lt;/code&gt; have been renamed to start with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manager.&lt;/code&gt;
instead. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master.*&lt;/code&gt; property names in the site configuration file (or passed on the
command-line) are converted internally to the new name, and a warning is printed. However, the old
name can still be used until at least the 3.0 release of Accumulo. Any &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master.*&lt;/code&gt; properties that
have been set in ZooKeeper will be automatically converted to the new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manager.*&lt;/code&gt; name when
Accumulo is upgraded. The old property names can still be used by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; shell command or
via the methods accessible via &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccumuloClient&lt;/code&gt;, but a warning will be generated when the old
names are used. You are encouraged to update all references to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; in your site configuration
files to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/code&gt; when installing Accumulo 2.1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The tablet balancers in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer&lt;/code&gt; package have all been
relocated to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer&lt;/code&gt;. DefaultLoadBalancer has been also
renamed to SimpleLoadBalancer along with the move. The default balancer has been updated from
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.TableLoadBalancer&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.TableLoadBalancer&lt;/code&gt;, and the default per-table
balancer has been updated from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.DefaultLoadBalancer&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.SimpleLoadBalancer&lt;/code&gt;. If you have customized the
tablet balancer configuration, you are strongly encouraged to update your configuration to
reference the updated balancer names. If you have written a custom tablet balancer, it should be
updated to implement the new interface
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.TabletBalancer&lt;/code&gt; rather than extending the deprecated
abstract &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.TabletBalancer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The configuration file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;masters&lt;/code&gt; for identifying the manager host(s) has been deprecated. If this
file is found, a warning will be printed. The replacement file &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;managers&lt;/code&gt; should be used (i.e.,
rename your masters file to managers) instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; argument to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo-service&lt;/code&gt; script has been deprecated, and the replacement
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;manager&lt;/code&gt; argument should be used instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-master&lt;/code&gt; argument to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.server.util.ZooZap&lt;/code&gt; utility has been deprecated
and the replacement &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-manager&lt;/code&gt; argument should be used instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GetMasterStats&lt;/code&gt; utility has been renamed to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GetManagerStats&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.master.state.SetGoalState&lt;/code&gt; is deprecated, and any custom scripts that invoke
this utility should be updated to call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.manager.state.SetGoalState&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;masterMemory&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;minicluster.properties&lt;/code&gt; has been deprecated and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;managerMemory&lt;/code&gt; should be used
instead in any &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;minicluster.properties&lt;/code&gt; files you have configured.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1640&quot;&gt;#1640&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1642&quot;&gt;#1642&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1703&quot;&gt;#1703&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1704&quot;&gt;#1704&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1873&quot;&gt;#1873&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1907&quot;&gt;#1907&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-tracing-facility&quot;&gt;New Tracing Facility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTrace support was removed in this release and has been replaced with &lt;a href=&quot;https://opentelemetry.io/&quot;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;. Trace information will not be shown in the monitor. See comments in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2259&quot;&gt;#2259&lt;/a&gt; for an example of how to configure Accumulo to emit traces to supported OpenTelemetry sinks.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2257&quot;&gt;#2257&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-metrics-implementation&quot;&gt;New Metrics Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hadoop Metrics2 framework is no longer being used to emit metrics from Accumulo. Accumulo is now
using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://micrometer.io/&quot;&gt;Micrometer&lt;/a&gt; framework. Metric name and type changes have been
documented in org.apache.accumulo.core.metrics.MetricsProducer, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.javadoc.io/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo-core/2.1.2/org/apache/accumulo/core/metrics/MetricsProducer.html&quot;&gt;javadoc&lt;/a&gt; for more information. See comments in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2305&quot;&gt;#2305&lt;/a&gt; for an example of how to configure Accumulo to emit metrics to supported Micrometer sinks.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1134&quot;&gt;#1134&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-spi-package&quot;&gt;New SPI Package&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new Service Plugin Interface (SPI) package was created in the accumulo-core jar, at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://static.javadoc.io/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo-core/2.1.2/org/apache/accumulo/core/spi/package-summary.html&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.core.spi&lt;/a&gt;, under which exists interfaces for the various pluggable
components. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1900&quot;&gt;#1900&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1905&quot;&gt;#1905&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1880&quot;&gt;#1880&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1891&quot;&gt;#1891&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1426&quot;&gt;#1426&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minor-improvements&quot;&gt;Minor Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-listtablets-shell-command&quot;&gt;New listtablets Shell Command&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new command was created for debugging called listtablets, that shows detailed tablet information
on a single line. This command aggregates data about a tablet such as status, location, size, number
of entries and HDFS directory name. It even shows the start and end rows of tablets, displaying them
in the same sorted order they are stored in the metadata. See example command output below. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1317&quot;&gt;#1317&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1821&quot;&gt;#1821&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-utility-for-generating-splits&quot;&gt;New Utility for Generating Splits&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new command line utility was created to generate split points from 1 or more rfiles. One or more
HDFS directories can be given as well. The utility will iterate over all the files provided and
determine the proper split points based on either the size or number given. It uses Apache
Datasketches to get the split points from the data. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2361&quot;&gt;#2361&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2368&quot;&gt;#2368&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-option-for-cloning-offline&quot;&gt;New Option for Cloning Offline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added option to leave cloned tables offline &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1474&quot;&gt;#1474&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1475&quot;&gt;#1475&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-max-tablets-option-in-bulk-import&quot;&gt;New Max Tablets Option in Bulk Import&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The property &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;table.bulk.max.tablets&lt;/code&gt; was created in new bulk import technique. This property acts
as a cluster performance failsafe to prevent a single ingested file from being distributed across
too much of a cluster. The value is enforced by the new bulk import technique and is the maximum
number of tablets allowed for one bulk import file. When this property is set, an error will be
thrown when the value is exceeded during a bulk import. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1614&quot;&gt;#1614&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-health-check-thread-in-tabletserver&quot;&gt;New Health Check Thread in TabletServer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new thread was added to the tablet server to periodically verify tablet metadata. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2320&quot;&gt;#2320&lt;/a&gt;
This thread also prints to the debug log how long it takes the tserver to scan the metadata table.
The property tserver.health.check.interval was added to control the frequency at which this health
check takes place. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2583&quot;&gt;#2583&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-ability-for-user-to-define-context-classloaders&quot;&gt;New ability for user to define context classloaders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deprecated the existing VFS ClassLoader for eventual removal and created a new mechanism for users
to load their own classloader implementations. The new VFS classloader and VFS context classloaders
are in a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo-classloaders/tree/main/modules/vfs-class-loader&quot;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; and can now be specified using Java’s own system
properties. Alternatively, one can set their own classloader (they always could do this). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1747&quot;&gt;#1747&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1715&quot;&gt;#1715&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please reference the Known Issues section of the 2.0.1 release notes for an issue affecting the
VFSClassLoader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-in-uncaught-exceptionerror-handling-in-server-side-threads&quot;&gt;Change in uncaught Exception/Error handling in server-side threads&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consolidated and normalized thread pool and thread creation. All threads created through this code
path will have an UncaughtExceptionHandler attached to it that will log the fact that the Thread
encountered an uncaught Exception and is now dead. When an Error is encountered in a server process,
it will attempt to print a message to stderr then terminate the VM using Runtime.halt. On the client
side, the default UncaughtExceptionHandler will only log the Exception/Error in the client and does
not terminate the VM. Additionally, the user has the ability to set their own
UncaughtExceptionHandler implementation on the client. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1808&quot;&gt;#1808&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1818&quot;&gt;#1818&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2554&quot;&gt;#2554&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;updated-hash-algorithm&quot;&gt;Updated hash algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the default password Authenticator, Accumulo used to store password hashes using SHA-256 and
using custom code to add a salt. In this release, we now use Apache commons-codec to store password
hashes in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;crypt(3)&lt;/code&gt; standard format. With this change, we’ve also defaulted to using the
stronger SHA-512. Existing stored password hashes (if upgrading from an earlier version of Accumulo)
will automatically be upgraded when users authenticate or change their passwords, and Accumulo will
log a warning if it detects any passwords have not been upgraded. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1787&quot;&gt;#1787&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1788&quot;&gt;#1788&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1798&quot;&gt;#1798&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1810&quot;&gt;#1810&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;various-performance-improvements-when-deleting-tables&quot;&gt;Various Performance improvements when deleting tables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make delete table operations cancel user compactions &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2030&quot;&gt;#2030&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2169&quot;&gt;#2169&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prevent compactions from starting when delete table is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2182&quot;&gt;#2182&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2240&quot;&gt;#2240&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added check to not flush when table is being deleted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1887&quot;&gt;#1887&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added log message before waiting for deletes to finish &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1881&quot;&gt;#1881&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Added code to stop user flush if table is being deleted &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1931&quot;&gt;#1931&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-monitor-pages-improvements--features&quot;&gt;New Monitor Pages, Improvements &amp;amp; Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A page was added to the Monitor that lists the active compactions and the longest running active
compaction. As an optimization, this page will only fetch data if a user loads the page and will
only do so a maximum of once a minute. This optimization was also added for the Active Scans page,
along with the addition of a “Fetched” column indicating when the data was retrieved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new feature was added to the TabletServer page to help users identify which tservers are in
recovery mode. When a tserver is recovering, its corresponding row in the TabletServer Status
table will be highlighted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new page was also created for External Compactions that allows users to see the progress of
compactions and other details about ongoing compactions (see below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2283&quot;&gt;#2283&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2294&quot;&gt;#2294&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2358&quot;&gt;#2358&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2663&quot;&gt;#2663&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/release/ec-running2.png&quot; alt=&quot;External Compactions&quot; style=&quot;width:85%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/release/ec-running-details.png&quot; alt=&quot;External Compactions Details&quot; style=&quot;width:85%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-tserver-scan-timeout-property&quot;&gt;New tserver scan timeout property&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new property &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tserver.scan.results.max.timeout&lt;/code&gt; was added to allow configuration of the timeout.
A bug was discovered where tservers were running out of memory, partially due to this timeout being
so short. The default value is 1 second, but now it can be increased. It is the max time for the
thrift client handler to wait for scan results before timing out. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2599&quot;&gt;#2599&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2598&quot;&gt;#2598&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-choose-volumes-for-new-tablet-files&quot;&gt;Always choose volumes for new tablet files&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1389&quot;&gt;#1389&lt;/a&gt;, we changed the behavior of the VolumeChooser. It now runs any time a new file is
created. This means VolumeChooser decisions are no longer “sticky” for tablets. This allows tablets
to balance their files across multiple HDFS volumes, instead of the first selected. Now, only the
directory name is “sticky” for a tablet, but the volume is not. So, new files will appear in a
directory named the same on different volumes that the VolumeChooser selects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iterators-package-is-now-public-api&quot;&gt;Iterators package is now public API&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1390&quot;&gt;#1390&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1400&quot;&gt;#1400&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1411&quot;&gt;#1411&lt;/a&gt; We declared that the core.iterators package is public
API, so it will now follow the semver rules for public API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;better-accumulo-gc-memory-usage&quot;&gt;Better accumulo-gc memory usage&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1543&quot;&gt;#1543&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1650&quot;&gt;#1650&lt;/a&gt; Switch from batching file candidates to delete based on the amount of
available memory, and instead use a fixed-size batching strategy. This allows the accumulo-gc to run
consistently using a batch size that is configurable by the user. The user is responsbile for
ensuring the process is given enough memory to accommodate the batch size they configure, but this
makes the process much more consistent and predictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;log4j2&quot;&gt;Log4j2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1528&quot;&gt;#1528&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1514&quot;&gt;#1514&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1515&quot;&gt;#1515&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1516&quot;&gt;#1516&lt;/a&gt; While we still use slf4j, we have
upgraded the default logger binding to log4j2, which comes with a bunch of features, such as dynamic
reconfiguration, colorized console logging, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;added-foreach-method-to-scanner&quot;&gt;Added forEach method to Scanner&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1742&quot;&gt;#1742&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1765&quot;&gt;#1765&lt;/a&gt; We added a forEach method to Scanner objects, so you can easily
iterate over the results using a lambda / BiConsumer that accepts a key-value pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-public-api-to-set-multiple-properties-atomically&quot;&gt;New public API to set multiple properties atomically&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2692&quot;&gt;#2692&lt;/a&gt; We added a new public API added to support setting multiple properties at once
atomically using a read-modify-write pattern. This is available for table, namespace, and system
properties, and is called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;modifyProperties()&lt;/code&gt;. This builds off a related change that allows us to
more efficiently store and properties in ZooKeeper, which also results in fewer ZooKeeper watches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simplified-cluster-configuration&quot;&gt;Simplified cluster configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2138&quot;&gt;#2138&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2903&quot;&gt;#2903&lt;/a&gt; Modified the accumulo-cluster script to read the server locations from a single
file, cluster.yaml, in the conf directory instead of multiple files (tserver, manager, gc, etc.). Starting the new scan server and compactor server types is supported using this new file.  It also contains options for starting multiple Tablet and Scan Servers per host.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2441&quot;&gt;#2441&lt;/a&gt; Upgraded to Junit 5&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2462&quot;&gt;#2462&lt;/a&gt; Added SUBMITTED FaTE status to differentiate between things submitted vs. running&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2807&quot;&gt;#2807&lt;/a&gt; Added several troubleshooting utilities to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo admin&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2820&quot;&gt;#2820&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2900&quot;&gt;#2900&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;du&lt;/code&gt; command performance improved by using the metadata table for
computation instead of HDFS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2966&quot;&gt;#2966&lt;/a&gt; Upgrade Thrift to 0.17.0&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>2.1.0 Metrics and Tracing Changes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Metrics and Tracing changed in 2.1.0. This post explains the new implementations and provides examples on how to configure them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;metrics&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accumulo was &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1817&quot;&gt;modified&lt;/a&gt; in version 1.7.0 (2015) to use the Hadoop Metrics2 framework for capturing and emitting internal Accumulo metrics. &lt;a href=&quot;https://micrometer.io/&quot;&gt;Micrometer&lt;/a&gt;, a newer metrics framework, supports sending metrics to many popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_supported_monitoring_systems&quot;&gt;monitoring systems&lt;/a&gt;. In Accumulo 2.1.0 support for the Hadoop Metrics2 framework has been removed in favor of using Micrometer. Metrics are disabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micrometer has the concept of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_registry&quot;&gt;MeterRegistry&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to create and emit metrics to the supported monitoring systems. Additionally, Micrometer supports sending metrics to multiple monitoring systems concurrently. Configuring Micrometer in Accumulo will require you to write a small peice of code to provide the MeterRegistry configuration. Specifically, you will need to create a class that implements &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/main/core/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/core/metrics/MeterRegistryFactory.java&quot;&gt;MeterRegistryFactory&lt;/a&gt;. Your implementation will need to create and configure the appropriate MeterRegistry. Additionally, you will need to add the MeterRegistry jar file and the jar file containing your MeterRegistryFactory implementation to Accumulo’s classpath. The page for each monitoring system that Micrometer supports contains instructions on how to configure the registry and which jar file is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accumulo’s metrics integration test uses a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/main/test/src/main/java/org/apache/accumulo/test/metrics/TestStatsDRegistryFactory.java&quot;&gt;TestStatsDRegistryFactory&lt;/a&gt; to create and configure a &lt;a href=&quot;https://micrometer.io/docs/registry/statsD&quot;&gt;StatsD Meter Registry&lt;/a&gt;. The instructions below provide an example of how to use this class to emit Accumulo’s metrics to a Telegraf - InfluxDB - Grafana monitoring stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;metrics-example&quot;&gt;Metrics Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example uses a Docker container that contains Telegraf-InfluxDB-Grafana system. We will configure Accumulo to send metrics to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/&quot;&gt;Telegraf&lt;/a&gt; component running in the Docker image. Telegraf will persist the metrics in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/&quot;&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/a&gt; and then we will visualize the metrics using &lt;a href=&quot;https://grafana.com/&quot;&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt;. This example assumes that you have installed Docker (or equivalent engine) and have an Accumulo database already installed and initialized. We will be installing some things, modifying the Accumulo configuration, and starting Accumulo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download the Telegraf-Influx-Grafana (TIG) Docker image
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker pull artlov/docker-telegraf-influxdb-grafana:latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create directories for the Docker container
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p /tmp/metrics/influxdb
chmod 777 /tmp/metrics/influxdb
mkdir /tmp/metrics/grafana
mkdir /tmp/metrics/grafana-dashboards
mkdir -p /tmp/metrics/telegraf/conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download Telegraf configuration and Grafana dashboard
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd /tmp/metrics/telegraf/conf
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/accumulo-testing/main/contrib/terraform-testing-infrastructure/modules/config-files/templates/telegraf.conf.tftpl
cat telegraf.conf.tftpl | sed &quot;s/\${manager_ip}/localhost/&quot; &amp;gt; telegraf.conf
cd /tmp/metrics/grafana-dashboards
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/accumulo-testing/main/contrib/terraform-testing-infrastructure/modules/config-files/files/grafana_dashboards/accumulo-dashboard.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/accumulo-testing/main/contrib/terraform-testing-infrastructure/modules/config-files/files/grafana_dashboards/accumulo-dashboard.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the TIG Docker container
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run --ulimit nofile=66000:66000 -d --rm \
 --name tig-stack \
 -p 3003:3003 \
 -p 3004:8888 \
 -p 8086:8086 \
 -p 22022:22 \
 -p 8125:8125/udp \
 -v /tmp/metrics/influxdb:/var/lib/influxdb \
 -v /tmp/metrics/grafana:/var/lib/grafana \
 -v /tmp/metrics/telegraf/conf:/etc/telegraf \
 -v /tmp/metrics/grafana-dashboards:/etc/grafana/provisioning/dashboards \
 artlov/docker-telegraf-influxdb-grafana:latest
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download Micrometer StatsD Meter Registry jar
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wget -O micrometer-registry-statsd-1.9.1.jar https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=io/micrometer/micrometer-registry-statsd/1.9.1/micrometer-registry-statsd-1.9.1.jar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At a mininum you need to enable the metrics using the property &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;general.micrometer.enabled&lt;/code&gt; and supply the name of the MeterRegistryFactory class using the property &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;general.micrometer.factory&lt;/code&gt;. To enable &lt;a href=&quot;https://micrometer.io/docs/ref/jvm&quot;&gt;JVM&lt;/a&gt; metrics, use the property &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;general.micrometer.jvm.metrics.enabled&lt;/code&gt;. Modify the accumulo.properties configuration file by adding the properties below.
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Micrometer settings
general.micrometer.enabled=true
general.micrometer.jvm.metrics.enabled=true
general.micrometer.factory=org.apache.accumulo.test.metrics.TestStatsDRegistryFactory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copy the micrometer-registry-statsd-1.9.1.jar and accumulo-test.jar into the Accumulo lib directory&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The TestStatsDRegistryFactory uses system properties to determine the host and port of the StatsD server. In this example the Telegraf component started in step 4 above contains a StatsD server listening on localhost:8125. Configure the TestStatsDRegistryFactory by adding the following system properties to the JAVA_OPTS variable in accumulo-env.sh.
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&quot;-Dtest.meter.registry.host=127.0.0.1&quot;
&quot;-Dtest.meter.registry.port=8125&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start Accumulo.  You should see the following statement in the server log files
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[metrics.MetricsUtil] INFO : initializing metrics, enabled:true, class:org.apache.accumulo.test.metrics.TestStatsDRegistryFactory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Log into Grafana (http://localhost:3003/) using the default credentials (root/root). Click the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/code&gt; icon at the top, then click the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Accumulo Micrometer Test Dashboard&lt;/code&gt;. If everything is working correctly, then you should see something like the image below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202206_metrics_and_tracing/Grafana_Screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Grafana Screenshot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;tracing&quot;&gt;Tracing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the retirement of HTrace, Accumulo has selected to replace it’s tracing functionality with &lt;a href=&quot;https://opentelemetry.io/&quot;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; in version 2.1.0. Hadoop appears to be on the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-15566&quot;&gt;path&lt;/a&gt; which, when finished, should provide better insight into Accumulo’s use of HDFS. OpenTelemetry supports exporting Trace information to several different systems, to include &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jaegertracing.io/&quot;&gt;Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://zipkin.io/&quot;&gt;Zipkin&lt;/a&gt;, and others. The HTrace trace spans in the Accumulo source code have been updated to use OpenTelemetry trace spans. If tracing is enabled, then Accumulo will use the OpenTelemetry implementation registered with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/api/all/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/api/GlobalOpenTelemetry.java&quot;&gt;GlobalOpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; object. Tracing is disabled by default and a no-op OpenTelemetry implementation is used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tracing-example&quot;&gt;Tracing Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This example uses the OpenTelemetry Java Agent jar file to configure and export trace information to Jaeger. The OpenTelemetry Java Agent jar file bundles together the supported Java exporters, provides a way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/a&gt; them, and registers them with the GlobalOpenTelemetry singleton that is used by Accumulo. An alternate method to supplying the OpenTelemetry dependencies, without using the Java Agent jar file, is to create a shaded jar with the OpenTelemetry &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure&quot;&gt;autoconfigure&lt;/a&gt; module and it’s runtime dependencies and place the resulting shaded jar on the classpath. An example Maven pom.xml file to create the shaded jar is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/pull/2259#issuecomment-965571339&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. When using this alternate method you can skip step 2 and the uncommenting of the java agent in step 5 below.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Download Jaeger all-in-one Docker image
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  docker pull jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.35
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download OpenTelemetry Java Agent (https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure)
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  wget -O opentelemetry-javaagent-1.15.0.jar https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=io/opentelemetry/javaagent/opentelemetry-javaagent/1.15.0/opentelemetry-javaagent-1.15.0.jar
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To enable tracing, you need to set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;general.opentelemetry.enabled&lt;/code&gt; property. Modify the accumulo.properties configuration file and add the following property.
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# OpenTelemetry settings
general.opentelemetry.enabled=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To enable tracing in the shell, set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;general.opentelemetry.enabled&lt;/code&gt; property in the accumulo-client.properties configuration file.
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# OpenTelemetry settings
general.opentelemetry.enabled=true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure the OpenTelemetry JavaAgent in accumulo-env.sh by uncommenting the following and updating the path to the java agent jar:
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  ## Optionally setup OpenTelemetry SDK AutoConfigure
  ## See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/tree/main/sdk-extensions/autoconfigure
  #JAVA_OPTS=('-Dotel.traces.exporter=jaeger' '-Dotel.metrics.exporter=none' '-Dotel.logs.exporter=none' &quot;${JAVA_OPTS[@]}&quot;)
  ## Optionally setup OpenTelemetry Java Agent
  ## See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation for more options
  #JAVA_OPTS=('-javaagent:path/to/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar' &quot;${JAVA_OPTS[@]}&quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start Jaeger Docker container
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker run -d --rm --name jaeger \

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start Accumulo.  You should see the following statement in the server log files
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[trace.TraceUtil] INFO : Trace enabled in Accumulo: yes, OpenTelemetry instance: class io.opentelemetry.javaagent.instrumentation.opentelemetryapi.v1_10.ApplicationOpenTelemetry110, Tracer instance: class io.opentelemetry.javaagent.instrumentation.opentelemetryapi.trace.ApplicationTracer
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;View traces in Jaeger UI at http://localhost:16686. You can select the service name on the left panel and click &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Find Traces&lt;/code&gt; to view the trace information. If everything is working correctly, then you should see something like the image below.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Apache Accumulo 1.10.2</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Accumulo 1.10.2 is a bug fix release of the 1.10 LTM release line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These release notes are highlights of the changes since 1.10.1. The full
detailed changes can be seen in the git history. If anything important is
missing from this list, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; us to have it included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of 1.10.1 or earlier are encouraged to upgrade to 1.10.2, as this is a
continuation of the 1.10 LTM release line with bug fixes and improvements, and
it supersedes any prior 1.x version. Users are also encouraged to consider
migrating to a 2.x version when one that is suitable for their needs becomes
available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;known-issues&quot;&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Commons VFS was upgraded in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1295&quot;&gt;#1295&lt;/a&gt; and some users have reported
issues similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/VFS/issues/VFS-683&quot;&gt;VFS-683&lt;/a&gt;. Possible solutions are discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2775&quot;&gt;#2775&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-improvements&quot;&gt;Major Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release bundles &lt;a href=&quot;https://reload4j.qos.ch/&quot;&gt;reload4j&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2458&quot;&gt;#2458&lt;/a&gt;) in
the convenience binary and uses that instead of log4j 1.2. This is to make it
easier for users to avoid the many CVEs that apply to log4j 1.2, which is no
longer being maintained. Accumulo 2.x versions will have already switched to
use the latest log4j 2. However, doing so required making some breaking API
changes and other substantial changes, so that can’t be done for Accumulo 1.10.
Using reload4j instead, was deemed to be a viable interim solution until
Accumulo 2.x.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-improvements&quot;&gt;Other Improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1808&quot;&gt;#1808&lt;/a&gt; Re-throw exceptions in threads instead of merely logging them&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1863&quot;&gt;#1863&lt;/a&gt; Avoid unnecessory redundant log sorting&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>External Compactions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;External compactions are a new feature in Accumulo 2.1.0 which allows
compaction work to run outside of Tablet Servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/68a74a85e1662fe02ff3967497f31fda7f32225c.pdf&quot;&gt;compactions&lt;/a&gt; in Accumulo - Minor and Major. Minor
compactions flush recently written data from memory to a new file. Major
compactions merge two or more Tablet files together into one new file. Starting
in 2.1 Tablet Servers can run multiple major compactions for a Tablet
concurrently; there is no longer a single thread pool per Tablet Server that
runs compactions. Major compactions can be resource intensive and may run for a
long time depending on several factors, to include the number and size of the
input files, and the iterators configured to run during major compaction.
Additionally, the Tablet Server does not currently have a mechanism in place to
stop a major compaction that is taking too long or using too many resources.
There is a mechanism to throttle the read and write speed of major compactions
as a way to reduce the resource contention on a Tablet Server where many
concurrent compactions are running. However, throttling compactions on a busy
system will just lead to an increasing amount of queued compactions. Finally,
major compaction work can be wasted in the event of an untimely death of the
Tablet Server or if a Tablet is migrated to another Tablet Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An external compaction is a major compaction that occurs outside of a Tablet
Server. The external compaction feature is an extension of the major compaction
service in the Tablet Server and is configured as part of the systems
compaction service configuration. Thus, it is an optional feature. The goal of
the external compaction feature is to overcome some of the drawbacks of the
Major compactions that happen inside the Tablet Server. Specifically, external
compactions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow major compactions to continue when the originating TabletServer dies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow major compactions to occur while a Tablet migrates to a new Tablet Server&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce the load on the TabletServer, giving it more cycles to insert mutations and respond to scans (assuming it’s running on different hosts).  MapReduce jobs and compactions can lower the effectiveness of processor and page caches for scans, so moving compactions off the host can be beneficial.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allow major compactions to be scaled differently than the number of TabletServers, giving users more flexibility in allocating resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even out hotspots where a few Tablet Servers have a lot of compaction work. External compactions allow this work to spread much wider than previously possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The external compaction feature in Apache Accumulo version 2.1.0 adds two new
system-level processes and new configuration properties. The new system-level
processes are the Compactor and the Compaction Coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Compactor is a process that is responsible for executing a major compaction. There can be many Compactor’s running on a system. The Compactor communicates with the Compaction Coordinator to get information about the next major compaction it will run and to report the completion state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Compaction Coordinator is a single process like the Manager. It is responsible for communicating with the Tablet Servers to gather information about queued external compactions, to reserve a major compaction on the Compactor’s behalf, and to report the completion status of the reserved major compaction.  For external compactions that complete when the Tablet is offline, the Compaction Coordinator buffers this information and reports it later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details&quot;&gt;Details&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we explain the implementation for external compactions, it’s probably
useful to explain the changes for major compactions that were made in the 2.1.0
branch before external compactions were added. This is most apparent in the
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tserver.compaction.major.service&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;table.compaction.dispatcher&lt;/code&gt; configuration
properties. The simplest way to explain this is that you can now define a
service for executing compactions and then assign that service to a table
(which implies you can have multiple services assigned to different tables).
This gives the flexibility to prevent one table’s compactions from impacting
another table. Each service has named thread pools with size thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration below defines a compaction service named cs1 using
the DefaultCompactionPlanner that is configured to have three named thread
pools (small, medium, and large). Each thread pool is configured with a number
of threads to run compactions and a size threshold. If the sum of the input
file sizes is less than 16MB, then the major compaction will be assigned to the
small pool, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tserver.compaction.major.service.cs1.planner=org.apache.accumulo.core.spi.compaction.DefaultCompactionPlanner
tserver.compaction.major.service.cs1.planner.opts.executors=[
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;small&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;internal&quot;,&quot;maxSize&quot;:&quot;16M&quot;,&quot;numThreads&quot;:8},
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;medium&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;internal&quot;,&quot;maxSize&quot;:&quot;128M&quot;,&quot;numThreads&quot;:4},
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;internal&quot;,&quot;numThreads&quot;:2}]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assign compaction service cs1 to the table ci, you would use the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;config -t ci -s table.compaction.dispatcher=org.apache.accumulo.core.spi.compaction.SimpleCompactionDispatcher
config -t ci -s table.compaction.dispatcher.opts.service=cs1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small modification to the
tserver.compaction.major.service.cs1.planner.opts.executors property in the
example above would enable it to use external compactions. For example, let’s
say that we wanted all of the large compactions to be done externally, you
would use this configuration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tserver.compaction.major.service.cs1.planner.opts.executors=[
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;small&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;internal&quot;,&quot;maxSize&quot;:&quot;16M&quot;,&quot;numThreads&quot;:8},
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;medium&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;internal&quot;,&quot;maxSize&quot;:&quot;128M&quot;,&quot;numThreads&quot;:4},
{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;external&quot;,&quot;queue&quot;:&quot;DCQ1&quot;}]'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example the queue DCQ1 can be any arbitrary name and allows you to
define multiple pools of Compactor’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind these new configurations in 2.1 lies a new algorithm for choosing which
files to compact.  This algorithm attempts to find the smallest set of files
that meets the compaction ratio criteria. Prior to 2.1, Accumulo looked for the
largest set of files that met the criteria.  Both algorithms do logarithmic
amounts of work.  The new algorithm better utilizes multiple thread pools
available for running comactions of different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compactor&quot;&gt;Compactor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Compactor is started with the name of the queue for which it will complete
major compactions. You pass in the queue name when starting the Compactor, like
so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bin/accumulo compactor -q DCQ1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once started the Compactor tries to find the location of the
Compaction Coordinator in ZooKeeper and connect to it. Then, it asks the
Compaction Coordinator for the next compaction job for the queue. The
Compaction Coordinator will return to the Compactor the necessary information to
run the major compaction, assuming there is work to be done. Note that the
class performing the major compaction in the Compactor is the same one used in
the Tablet Server, so we are just transferring all of the input parameters from
the Tablet Server to the Compactor. The Compactor communicates information back
to the Compaction Coordinator when the compaction has started, finished
(successfully or not), and during the compaction (progress updates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;compaction-coordinator&quot;&gt;Compaction Coordinator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Compaction Coordinator is a singleton process in the system like the
Manager. Also, like the Manager it supports standby Compaction Coordinator’s
using locks in ZooKeeper. The Compaction Coordinator is started using the
command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bin/accumulo compaction-coordinator
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When running, the Compaction Coordinator polls the TabletServers for summary
information about their external compaction queues. It keeps track of the major
compaction priorities for each Tablet Server and queue. When a Compactor
requests the next major compaction job the Compaction Coordinator finds the
Tablet Server with the highest priority major compaction for that queue and
communicates with that Tablet Server to reserve an external compaction. The
priority in this case is an integer value based on the number of input files
for the compaction. For system compactions, the number is negative starting at
-32768 and increasing to -1 and for user compactions it’s a non-negative number
starting at 0 and limited to 32767. When the Tablet Server reserves the
external compaction an entry is written into the metadata table row for the
Tablet with the address of the Compactor running the compaction and all of the
configuration information passed back from the Tablet Server. Below is an
example of the ecomp metadata column:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2;10ba2e8ba2e8ba5 ecomp:ECID:94db8374-8275-4f89-ba8b-4c6b3908bc50 []    {&quot;inputs&quot;:[&quot;hdfs://accucluster/accumulo/tables/2/t-00000ur/A00001y9.rf&quot;,&quot;hdfs://accucluster/accumulo/tables/2/t-00000ur/C00005lp.rf&quot;,&quot;hdfs://accucluster/accumulo/tables/2/t-00000ur/F0000dqm.rf&quot;,&quot;hdfs://accucluster/accumulo/tables/2/t-00000ur/F0000dq1.rf&quot;],&quot;nextFiles&quot;:[],&quot;tmp&quot;:&quot;hdfs://accucluster/accumulo/tables/2/t-00000ur/C0000dqs.rf_tmp&quot;,&quot;compactor&quot;:&quot;10.2.0.139:9133&quot;,&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;SYSTEM&quot;,&quot;executorId&quot;:&quot;DCQ1&quot;,&quot;priority&quot;:-32754,&quot;propDels&quot;:true,&quot;selectedAll&quot;:false}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Compactor notifies the Compaction Coordinator that it has finished the
major compaction, the Compaction Coordinator attempts to notify the Tablet
Server and inserts an external compaction final state marker into the metadata
table. Below is an example of the final state marker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ecompECID:de6afc1d-64ae-4abf-8bce-02ec0a79aa6c : []        {&quot;extent&quot;:{&quot;tableId&quot;:&quot;2&quot;},&quot;state&quot;:&quot;FINISHED&quot;,&quot;fileSize&quot;:12354,&quot;entries&quot;:100000}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Compaction Coordinator is able to reach the Tablet Server and that Tablet
Server is still hosting the Tablet, then the compaction is committed and both
of the entries are removed from the metadata table. In the case that the Tablet
is offline when the compaction attempts to commit, there is a thread in the
Compaction Coordinator that looks for completed, but not yet committed, external
compactions and periodically attempts to contact the Tablet Server hosting the
Tablet to commit the compaction. The Compaction Coordinator periodically removes
the final state markers related to Tablets that no longer exist. In the case of
an external compaction failure the Compaction Coordinator notifies the Tablet
and the Tablet cleans up file reservations and removes the metadata entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;edge-cases&quot;&gt;Edge Cases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several situations involving external compactions that we tested as part of this feature. These are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tablet migration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a user initiated compaction is canceled&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What a Table is taken offline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When a Tablet is split or merged&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coordinator restart&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tablet Server death&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Table deletion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compactors periodically check if the compaction they are running is related to
a deleted table, split/merged Tablet, or canceled user initiated compaction. If
any of these cases happen the Compactor interrupts the compaction and notifies
the Compaction Coordinator. An external compaction continues in the case of
Tablet Server death, Tablet migration, Coordinator restart, and the Table being
taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cluster-test&quot;&gt;Cluster Test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following tests were run on a cluster to exercise this new feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run continuous ingest for 24h with large compactions running externally in an autoscaled Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;After ingest completion, started a full table compaction with all compactions running externally.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run continuous ingest verification process that looks for lost data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setup&quot;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these tests Accumulo, Zookeeper, and HDFS were run on a cluster in Azure
setup by Muchos and external compactions were run in a separate Kubernetes
cluster running in Azure.  The Accumulo cluster had the following
configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Centos 7&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open JDK 11&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zookeeper 3.6.2&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hadoop 3.3.0&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accumulo 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/commit/dad7e01ae7d450064cba5d60a1e0770311ebdb64&quot;&gt;dad7e01&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;23 D16s_v4 VMs, each with 16x128G HDDs stripped using LVM. 22 were workers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following diagram shows how the two clusters were setup.  The Muchos and
Kubernetes clusters were on the same private vnet, each with its own /16 subnet
in the 10.x.x.x IP address space.  The Kubernetes cluster that ran external
compactions was backed by at least 3 D8s_v4 VMs, with VMs autoscaling with the
number of pods running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/clusters-layout.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cluster Layout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem we ran into was communication between Compactors running inside
Kubernetes with processes like the Compaction Coordinator and DataNodes running
outside of Kubernetes in the Muchos cluster.  For some insights into how these
problems were overcome, checkout the comments in the &lt;a href=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/accumulo-compactor-muchos.yaml&quot;&gt;deployment
spec&lt;/a&gt; used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration-1&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following Accumulo shell commands set up a new compaction service named
cs1.  This compaction service has an internal executor with 4 threads named
small for compactions less than 32M, an internal executor with 2 threads named
medium for compactions less than 128M, and an external compaction queue named
DCQ1 for all other compactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;config -s 'tserver.compaction.major.service.cs1.planner.opts.executors=[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;small&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;internal&quot;,&quot;maxSize&quot;:&quot;32M&quot;,&quot;numThreads&quot;:4},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;medium&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;internal&quot;,&quot;maxSize&quot;:&quot;128M&quot;,&quot;numThreads&quot;:2},{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;external&quot;,&quot;queue&quot;:&quot;DCQ1&quot;}]'
config -s tserver.compaction.major.service.cs1.planner=org.apache.accumulo.core.spi.compaction.DefaultCompactionPlanner
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The continuous ingest table was configured to use the above compaction service.
The table’s compaction ratio was also lowered from the default of 3 to 2.  A
lower compaction ratio results in less files per Tablet and more compaction
work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;config -t ci -s table.compaction.dispatcher=org.apache.accumulo.core.spi.compaction.SimpleCompactionDispatcher
config -t ci -s table.compaction.dispatcher.opts.service=cs1
config -t ci -s table.compaction.major.ratio=2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Compaction Coordinator was manually started on the Muchos VM where the
Accumulo Manager, Zookeeper server, and the Namenode were running. The
following command was used to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;nohup accumulo compaction-coordinator &amp;gt;/var/data/logs/accumulo/compaction-coordinator.out 2&amp;gt;/var/data/logs/accumulo/compaction-coordinator.err &amp;amp;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start Compactors, Accumulo’s
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo-docker/tree/next-release&quot;&gt;docker&lt;/a&gt; image was
built from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;next-release&lt;/code&gt; branch by checking out the Apache Accumulo git
repo at commit &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/commit/dad7e01ae7d450064cba5d60a1e0770311ebdb64&quot;&gt;dad7e01&lt;/a&gt; and building the binary distribution using the
command &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mvn clean package -DskipTests&lt;/code&gt;. The resulting tar file was copied to
the accumulo-docker base directory and the image was built using the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;docker build --build-arg ACCUMULO_VERSION=2.1.0-SNAPSHOT --build-arg ACCUMULO_FILE=accumulo-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz \
             --build-arg HADOOP_FILE=hadoop-3.3.0.tar.gz \
             --build-arg ZOOKEEPER_VERSION=3.6.2  --build-arg ZOOKEEPER_FILE=apache-zookeeper-3.6.2-bin.tar.gz  \
             -t accumulo .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Docker image was tagged and then pushed to a container registry accessible by
Kubernetes. Then the following commands were run to start the Compactors using
&lt;a href=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/accumulo-compactor-muchos.yaml&quot;&gt;accumulo-compactor-muchos.yaml&lt;/a&gt;.
The yaml file contains comments explaining issues related to IP addresses and DNS names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl apply -f accumulo-compactor-muchos.yaml
kubectl autoscale deployment accumulo-compactor --cpu-percent=80 --min=10 --max=660
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The autoscale command causes Compactors to scale between 10
and 660 pods based on CPU usage. When pods average CPU is above 80%, then
pods are added to meet the 80% goal. When it’s below 80%, pods
are stopped to meet the 80% goal with 5 minutes between scale down
events. This can sometimes lead to running compactions being
stopped. During the test there were ~537 dead compactions that were probably
caused by this (there were 44K successful external compactions). The max of 660
was chosen based on the number of datanodes in the Muchos cluster.  There were
22 datanodes and 30x22=660, so this conceptually sets a limit of 30 external
compactions per datanode.  This was well tolerated by the Muchos cluster.  One
important lesson we learned is that external compactions can strain the HDFS
DataNodes, so it’s important to consider how many concurrent external
compactions will be running. The Muchos cluster had 22x16=352 cores on the
worker VMs, so the max of 660 exceeds what the Muchos cluster could run itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ingesting-data&quot;&gt;Ingesting data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After starting Compactors, 22 continuous ingest clients (from
accumulo-testing) were started.  The following plot shows the number of
compactions running in the three different compaction queues
configured.  The executor cs1_small is for compactions &amp;lt;= 32M and it stayed
pretty busy as minor compactions constantly produce new small files.  In 2.1.0
merging minor compactions were removed, so it’s important to ensure a
compaction queue is properly configured for new small files. The executor
cs1_medium was for compactions &amp;gt;32M and &amp;lt;=128M and it was not as busy, but did
have steady work.  The external compaction queue DCQ1 processed all compactions
over 128M and had some spikes of work.  These spikes are to be expected with
continuous ingest as all Tablets are written to evenly and eventually all of
the Tablets need to run large compactions around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/ci-running.png&quot; alt=&quot;Compactions Running&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following plot shows the number of pods running in Kubernetes.  As
Compactors used more and less CPU the number of pods automatically scaled up
and down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/ci-pods-running.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pods Running&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following plot shows the number of compactions queued.  When the
compactions queued for cs1_small spiked above 750, it was adjusted from 4
threads per Tablet Server to 6 threads.  This configuration change was made while
everything was running and the Tablet Servers saw it and reconfigured their thread
pools on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/ci-queued.png&quot; alt=&quot;Pods Queued&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The metrics emitted by Accumulo for these plots had the following names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TabletServer1.tserver.compactionExecutors.e_DCQ1_queued&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TabletServer1.tserver.compactionExecutors.e_DCQ1_running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TabletServer1.tserver.compactionExecutors.i_cs1_medium_queued&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TabletServer1.tserver.compactionExecutors.i_cs1_medium_running&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TabletServer1.tserver.compactionExecutors.i_cs1_small_queued&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TabletServer1.tserver.compactionExecutors.i_cs1_small_running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tablet servers emit metrics about queued and running compactions for every
compaction executor configured.  User can observe these metrics and tune
the configuration based on what they see, as was done in this test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following plot shows the average files per Tablet during the
test. The numbers are what would be expected for a compaction ratio of 2 when
the system is keeping up with compaction work. Also, animated GIFs were created to
show a few tablets &lt;a href=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/files_over_time.html&quot;&gt;files over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/ci-files-per-tablet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Files Per Tablet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a plot of the number Tablets during the test.
Eventually there were 11.28K Tablets around 512 Tablets per Tablet Server.  The
Tablets were close to splitting again at the end of the test as each Tablet was
getting close to 1G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/ci-online-tablets.png&quot; alt=&quot;Online Tablets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following plot shows ingest rate over time.  The rate goes down as the
number of Tablets per Tablet Server goes up, this is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/ci-ingest-rate.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ingest Rate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following plot shows the number of key/values in Accumulo during
the test.  When ingest was stopped, there were 266 billion key values in the
continuous ingest table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/ci-entries.png&quot; alt=&quot;Table Entries&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-table-compaction&quot;&gt;Full table compaction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stopping ingest and letting things settle, a full table compaction was
kicked off. Since all of these compactions would be over 128M, all of them were
scheduled on the external queue DCQ1.  The two plots below show compactions
running and queued for the ~2 hours it took to do the compaction. When the
compaction was initiated there were 10 Compactors running in pods.  All 11K
Tablets were queued for compaction and because the pods were always running
high CPU Kubernetes kept adding pods until the max was reached resulting in 660
Compactors running until all the work was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/full-table-compaction-queued.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full Table Compactions Running&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/202107_ecomp/full-table-compaction-running.png&quot; alt=&quot;Full Table Compactions Queued&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;verification&quot;&gt;Verification&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After running everything mentioned above, the continuous ingest verification
map reduce job was run.  This job looks for holes in the linked list produced
by continuous ingest which indicate Accumulo lost data.  No holes were found.
The counts below were emitted by the job.  If there were holes a non-zero
UNDEFINED count would be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;        org.apache.accumulo.testing.continuous.ContinuousVerify$Counts
                REFERENCED=266225036149
                UNREFERENCED=22010637
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hurdles&quot;&gt;Hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-scale-up&quot;&gt;How to Scale Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran into several issues running the Compactors in Kubernetes. First, we knew
that we could use Kubernetes &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/&quot;&gt;Horizontal Pod Autoscaler&lt;/a&gt; (HPA) to scale the
Compactors up and down based on load. But the question remained how to do that.
Probably the best metric to use for scaling the Compactors is the size of the
external compaction queue. Another possible solution is to take the DataNode
utilization into account somehow. We found that in scaling up the Compactors
based on their CPU usage we could overload DataNodes.  Once DataNodes were
overwhelmed, Compactors CPU would drop and the number of pods would naturally
scale down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use custom metrics you would need to get the metrics from Accumulo into a
metrics store that has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/metrics/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATIONS.md#custom-metrics-api&quot;&gt;metrics adapter&lt;/a&gt;. One possible solution, available
in Hadoop 3.3.0, is to use Prometheus, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/prometheus-adapter&quot;&gt;Prometheus Adapter&lt;/a&gt;, and enable
the Hadoop PrometheusMetricsSink added in
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-16398&quot;&gt;HADOOP-16398&lt;/a&gt; to expose the custom queue
size metrics. This seemed like the right solution, but it also seemed like a
lot of work that was outside the scope of this blog post. Ultimately we decided
to take the simplest approach - use the native Kubernetes metrics-server and
scale off CPU usage of the Compactors. As you can see in the “Compactions Queued”
and “Compactions Running” graphs above from the full table compaction, it took about
45 minutes for Kubernetes to scale up Compactors to the maximum configured (660). Compactors
likely would have been scaled up much faster if scaling was done off the queued compactions
instead of CPU usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gracefully-scaling-down&quot;&gt;Gracefully Scaling Down&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes Pod &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-termination&quot;&gt;termination process&lt;/a&gt; provides a mechanism for the user to
define a pre-stop hook that will be called before the Pod is terminated.
Without this hook Kubernetes sends a SIGTERM to the Pod, followed by a
user-defined grace period, then a SIGKILL. For the purposes of this test we did
not define a pre-stop hook or a grace period. It’s likely possible to handle
this situation more gracefully, but for this test our Compactors were killed
and the compaction work lost when the HPA decided to scale down the Compactors.
It was a good test of how we handled failed Compactors.  Investigation is
needed to determine if changes are needed in Accumulo to facilitate graceful
scale down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-connect&quot;&gt;How to Connect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major issue we ran into was connectivity between the Compactors and
the other server processes. The Compactor communicates with ZooKeeper and the
Compaction Coordinator, both of which were running outside of Kubernetes.  There
is no common DNS between the Muchos and Kubernetes cluster, but IPs were
visible to both. The Compactor connects to ZooKeeper to find the address of the
Compaction Coordinator so that it can connect to it and look for work. By
default the Accumulo server processes use the hostname as their address which
would not work as those names would not resolve inside the Kubernetes cluster.
We had to start the Accumulo processes using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; argument and set the
hostname to the IP address. Solving connectivity issues between components
running in Kubernetes and components external to Kubernetes depends on the capabilities
available in the environment and the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; option may be part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post we introduced the concept and benefits of external
compactions, the new server processes and how to configure the compaction
service. We deployed a 23-node Accumulo cluster using Muchos with a variable
sized Kubernetes cluster that dynamically scaled Compactors on 3 to 100 compute
nodes from 10 to 660 instances. We ran continuous ingest on the Accumulo
cluster to create compactions that were run both internal and external to the
Tablet Server and demonstrated external compactions completing successfully and
Compactors being killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed also running the following test, but did not have time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agitating the Compaction Coordinator, Tablet Servers and Compactors while ingest was running.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparing the impact on queries for internal vs external compactions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Having multiple external compaction queues, each with its own set of autoscaled Compactor pods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forcing full table compactions while ingest was running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test we ran shows that basic functionality works well, it would be nice to
stress the feature in other ways though.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jshell Accumulo Feature</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First introduced in Java 9, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/jshell/introduction-jshell.htm#JSHEL-GUID-630F27C8-1195-4989-9F6B-2C51D46F52C8&quot;&gt;JShell&lt;/a&gt; is an interactive Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL)
Java tool that interprets user’s input and outputs the results. This tool provides a convenient
way to test out and execute quick tasks with Accumulo in the terminal. This feature is a part
of the upcoming Accumulo 2.1 release. If you’re a developer and want to get involved in testing,
&lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us/&quot;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; or review our &lt;a href=&quot;/how-to-contribute/&quot;&gt;contributing guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-features&quot;&gt;Major Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Default JShell script provides initial imports for interacting with Accumulo’s API and
provided in Accumulo’s binary distribution tarball&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;On startup, JShell Accumulo  will automatically import the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CLASSPATH&lt;/code&gt;, load in a configured
environment from user’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conf/accumulo-env.sh&lt;/code&gt;, and invoke &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conf/jshell-init.jsh&lt;/code&gt;
to allow rapid Accumulo task executions&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;JShell Accumulo can startup using default/custom JShell script and users can append any JShell
command-line &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/jshell.htm#JSWOR-GUID-C337353B-074A-431C-993F-60C226163F00&quot;&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; to the startup command&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;booting-up-jshell-accumulo&quot;&gt;Booting Up JShell Accumulo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Open up a terminal and navigate to Accumulo’s installation directory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) To startup JShell with &lt;strong&gt;default script&lt;/strong&gt; use this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;bin/accumulo jshell
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) To startup JShell with &lt;strong&gt;custom script&lt;/strong&gt; use this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;bin/accumulo jshell &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--startup&lt;/span&gt; file/path/to/custom_script.jsh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; One can execute the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jshell&lt;/code&gt; command to startup JShell. However, doing so will require
manually importing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CLASSPATH&lt;/code&gt; and the configured environment from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conf/accumulo-env.sh&lt;/code&gt;
and manually specifying the startup file for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conf/jshell-init.jsh&lt;/code&gt; before any Accumulo tasks
can be performed. Using one of the startup commands above will automate that process
for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;jshell-accumulo-default-script&quot;&gt;JShell Accumulo Default Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auto-generated &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jshell-init.jsh&lt;/code&gt; is a customizable file located in Accumulo’s installation
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conf/&lt;/code&gt; directory. Inside, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jshell-init.jsh&lt;/code&gt; contains &lt;a href=&quot;/api/&quot;&gt;Accumulo Java APIs&lt;/a&gt;
formatted as import statements and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo-core/latest/org/apache/accumulo/core/client/AccumuloClient.html&quot;&gt;AccumuloClient&lt;/a&gt; build implementation. On startup,
the script automatically loads in the APIs and attempts to construct a client. Should additional
APIs and/or code implementations be needed, simply append them to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jshell-init.jsh&lt;/code&gt;.
Alternatively, you can create a separate JShell script and specify the custom script’s file path
on startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To construct an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.apache.accumulo/accumulo-core/latest/org/apache/accumulo/core/client/AccumuloClient.html&quot;&gt;AccumuloClient&lt;/a&gt;, the provided &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;conf/jshell-init.jsh&lt;/code&gt; script finds
and uses &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo-client.properties&lt;/code&gt; in Accumulo’s class path, and assigns the result
to a variable called &lt;strong&gt;client&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo-client.properties&lt;/code&gt; is found, a similar result will be produced below:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Gotham Police Department Persons of Interest:&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// A Scanner is an extension of java.lang.Iterable so behaves just like one.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Key : %-50s Value : %s\n&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The fully-qualified class name for Accumulo Scanner or
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;org.apache.accumulo.core.client.Scanner&lt;/code&gt; needs to be used due to conflicting issues with
Java’s built-in java.util.Scanner. However, to shorten the Accumulo Scanner’s declaration, assign
scan to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ScannerBase&lt;/code&gt; type instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Executing the Accumulo task above outputs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mutation ==&amp;gt; org.apache.accumulo.core.data.Mutation@1

jshell&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Apache Accumulo 2.0.1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Apache Accumulo 2.0.1 contains bug fixes for 2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since 2.0 is a non-LTM release line, and since an LTM release line has not yet
been made available for 2.x, this patch backports critical bug fixes to 2.0 to
address security bug &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-17533&quot;&gt;CVE-2020-17533&lt;/a&gt; that could affect any existing 2.0.0
users. Users that have already migrated to 2.0.0 are urged to upgrade to 2.0.1
as soon as possible, and users of 1.10 who wish to upgrade to 2.0 should
upgrade directly to 2.0.1, bypassing 2.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These release notes are highlights of the changes since 2.0.0. The full
detailed changes can be seen in the git history. If anything is missing from
this list, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; us to have it included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;known-issues&quot;&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Commons VFS was upgraded in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1295&quot;&gt;#1295&lt;/a&gt; and some users have reported
issues similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/VFS/issues/VFS-683&quot;&gt;VFS-683&lt;/a&gt;. Possible solutions are discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/2775&quot;&gt;#2775&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;critical-bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Critical Bug Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release includes critical bug fixes to fix security bugs identified as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-17533&quot;&gt;CVE-2020-17533&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1828&quot;&gt;#1828&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1832&quot;&gt;#1832&lt;/a&gt; Throw exceptions when permission checks fail,
and improve test coverage for permissions checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Other Bug Fixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1839&quot;&gt;#1839&lt;/a&gt; Fix AccumuloClient’s builder to prevent it from modifying a
provided Properties object when building a client from Properties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;note-about-newer-jdk-versions-11-and-later&quot;&gt;Note About Newer JDK Versions (11 and later)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While work has been done on other branches to better support newer JDK
versions, that is not the case for this non-LTM release. Certain non-critical
aspects of this release are known to break with some newer versions of JDK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;maven-javadoc-plugin&lt;/code&gt; may fail to generate the
javadocs using a newer JDK’s javadoc tool. In addition, this release assumes
the use of the CMS garbage collector in its build tests and in minicluster.
Newer JDKs, where CMS has been removed, may fail to execute Accumulo build
tests in this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it is recommended to use JDK 8 or JDK 11 with this release, which
are known to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;note-about-zookeeper-versions-35-and-later&quot;&gt;Note About ZooKeeper Versions 3.5 and Later&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release assumes the use of ZooKeeper 3.4. While work has been done on
other branches to better support newer ZooKeeper versions (3.5 and later), this
is a targeted release to fix specific bugs and does not include those kinds of
improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in order to use this release with ZooKeeper versions 3.5 and later,
you may need to edit your default class path, or perform other minor changes to
work smoothly with those versions of ZooKeeper. Please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; us if you need
assistance working with newer versions of ZooKeeper.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apache Accumulo 1.10.1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Accumulo 1.10.1 is a bug fix release of the 1.10 LTM release line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These release notes are highlights of the changes since 1.10.0. The full
detailed changes can be seen in the git history. If anything is missing from
this list, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; us to have it included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of 1.10.0 or earlier are urged to upgrade to 1.10.1 as soon as possible,
as this is a continuation of the 1.10 LTM release line with critical bug fixes
for security bug &lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-17533&quot;&gt;CVE-2020-17533&lt;/a&gt;. Users are also encouraged to consider
migrating to a 2.x version when one that is suitable for their needs becomes
available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;critical-bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Critical Bug Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release includes critical bug fixes to fix security bugs identified as
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-17533&quot;&gt;CVE-2020-17533&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1830&quot;&gt;#1830&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1832&quot;&gt;#1832&lt;/a&gt; Throw exceptions when permission checks fail,
and improve test coverage for permissions checks (backport of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1828&quot;&gt;#1828&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Other Bug Fixes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1716&quot;&gt;#1716&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1729&quot;&gt;#1729&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1737&quot;&gt;#1737&lt;/a&gt; Improvements in tool.sh,
including better support for newer ZooKeeper and Hadoop versions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1829&quot;&gt;#1829&lt;/a&gt; Improve log message in Delete Cleanup FATE&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1734&quot;&gt;#1734&lt;/a&gt; Support building native libraries on alpine-based distros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;note-about-jdk-15&quot;&gt;Note About JDK 15&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accumulo 1.x assumes the use of the CMS garbage collector in its build tests
and in the minicluster code. That garbage collector was removed in newer
versions of Java, and the build flags for Java that supported configuring the
CMS garbage collector now cause errors if attempted to be used with Java 15 or
later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, a change was made in 1.10.1’s build to fail fast if attempting to
build with JDK 15 or later (using JDK 11 or later was already a build
requirement).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need to build on JDK 15 or later, and intend to skip tests and don’t
intend to use minicluster, you can bypass this build constraint by building
with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-Denforcer.skip&lt;/code&gt;, as a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Apache Accumulo 1.10.0</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;about&quot;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Accumulo 1.10.0 is a continuation of the 1.x release line, and is
essentially the next maintenance release of 1.8/1.9, following the 1.9.3
version with some small additional internal improvements. Earlier 1.x versions
are now superseded by this maintenance release, and will no longer be
maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html&quot;&gt;semver&lt;/a&gt; minor version number increase (1.9 to 1.10) signals that this
release is backwards compatible with previous minor releases (1.8 and 1.9).
Rather than API additions, the primary reason for this minor version increase
is due to the decision to make Java 8 the minimum supported Java version (see
below for more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release contains contributions from more than 13 contributors from the
Apace Accumulo community in over 80 commits and 16 months of work since the
1.9.3 release. These release notes are highlights of those changes. The full
detailed changes can be seen in the git history. If anything is missing from
this list, please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; us to have it included.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;/contributor/versioning#LTM&quot;&gt;Long Term Maintenance (LTM)&lt;/a&gt; strategy, the intent is to
maintain the 1.10 release line with critical bug and security fixes until one
year after the next LTM version is released. However, this is anticipated to be
the final 1.x legacy release, so it is not expected to receive any new features
or significant non-critical updates, so users wanting new features should plan
to upgrade to a 2.x release, where new feature development is still being done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users of 1.9.3 or earlier are urged to upgrade to 1.10.0 as soon as it is
available, as this is a continuation of the 1.9 maintenance line. and to
consider migrating to a 2.x version when a suitable one becomes available.
Accumulo 2.0.0 is currently available, and 2.1.0 is anticipated to be the next
LTM release. If you would like to start preparing for 2.1.0 now, one way to do
this is to start building and testing the next version of your software against
Accumulo 2.0.0 because all 2.x releases should be backwards compatible with
2.0.0, following &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html&quot;&gt;semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;minimum-requirements&quot;&gt;Minimum Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The versions mentioned here are a guide only. It is not expected that our
convenience binary tarball will work out-of-the-box with your particular
environment, and some responsibility is placed on users to properly configure
Accumulo, or even patch and rebuild it from source, for their particular
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; us or file a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues&quot;&gt;bug report&lt;/a&gt; if you have trouble with a
specific version or wish to seek tips. Be prepared to provide details of the
problems you encounter, as well as perform some troubleshooting steps of your
own, in order to get the best response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;java-8&quot;&gt;Java 8&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java 8 is now the minimum supported Java version, and it is designed to work on
Java 11, as well. To build the project from source, Java 11 or later is
required. Please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact-us&quot;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; us if you find any bugs on any Java version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hadoop-2-or-3&quot;&gt;Hadoop 2 or 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release has been built using Hadoop 2.6.5, and is expected to work with
any Hadoop version 2.6.5 or later. It has also been tested with 3.0.3, and is
expected to work with Hadoop 3.0 versions as well. Hadoop 3.1.3, 3.2.1, and
3.3.0 have also been tested with this version, and are known to work (with at
least basic functionality) with some class path modifications (specifically,
using Guava 27.0-jre instead of the provided 14.0 version).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Particular class path pain points are known to be guava, commons-io,
commons-vfs2, and possibly other commons libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;zookeeper&quot;&gt;ZooKeeper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release has been built agains ZooKeeper 3.4.14, the latest 3.4 release. It
is known to work against 3.5 and 3.6 versions as well, when configured
properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Major Bug Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;accumulo-gc-bug&quot;&gt;Accumulo GC Bug&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1314&quot;&gt;#1314&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1318&quot;&gt;#1318&lt;/a&gt; Eliminate task creation leak caused by the an
additional timed-task created for each &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo-gc&lt;/code&gt; cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bulk-import-concurrency-bug&quot;&gt;Bulk Import Concurrency Bug&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1153&quot;&gt;#1153&lt;/a&gt; Prevent multiple threads from working on same bulk file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prevent-metadata-corruption&quot;&gt;Prevent Metadata Corruption&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1309&quot;&gt;#1309&lt;/a&gt; Prevent cloning of the metadata table, which could lead to
data loss during &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo-gc&lt;/code&gt; for either the clone or the original
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo.metadata&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1310&quot;&gt;#1310&lt;/a&gt; Improve GC handling of WALs used by root tablet. If the root
tablet had WALs, the GC did not consider them during collection&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1379&quot;&gt;#1379&lt;/a&gt; During GC scans, an error will be thrown if the GC fails
consistency checks; added a check to ensure the last tablet was seen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-miscellaneous-bug-fixes&quot;&gt;Other Miscellaneous Bug Fixes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1107&quot;&gt;#1107&lt;/a&gt; Fix &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ConcurrentModificationException&lt;/code&gt; in
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;HostRegexTableLoadBalancer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1185&quot;&gt;#1185&lt;/a&gt; Fixed a bug where we were using an unauthenticated ZooKeeper
client to try to read data with an ACL configured; this was previously
permitted until ZooKeeper fixed a security bug in their own code, which
revealed our incorrect ZooKeeper client code&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1371&quot;&gt;#1371&lt;/a&gt; Fix a bug in our MapReduce code that prevented some users from
reading tables they had valid permissions to read&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1401&quot;&gt;#1401&lt;/a&gt; Display trace information correctly in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo-monitor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1478&quot;&gt;#1478&lt;/a&gt; Don’t ignore the instance and zookeepers parameters on the
command-line when running certain utilities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1532&quot;&gt;#1532&lt;/a&gt; Remove need for ANT on classpath&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1555&quot;&gt;#1555&lt;/a&gt; Fix idempotency bug in importtable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1644&quot;&gt;#1644&lt;/a&gt; Retry minor compactions to prevent transient iterator issues
blocking forever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-improvements&quot;&gt;Major Improvements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;performance-enhancements&quot;&gt;Performance Enhancements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/990&quot;&gt;#990&lt;/a&gt; Avoid multiple threads loading same cache block&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1352&quot;&gt;#1352&lt;/a&gt; Add an option to configure the metadata action after an
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;accumulo-gc&lt;/code&gt; cycle using a new property instead of a hard-coded compaction
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/1.10/accumulo_user_manual#_gc_post_metadata_action&quot;&gt;gc.post.metadata.action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1462&quot;&gt;#1462&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1526&quot;&gt;#1526&lt;/a&gt; Temporarily cache the existence check for
recovery WALs, so multiple tablets pointing to the same WAL to avoid
expensive redundant checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;identifying-busy-tablets&quot;&gt;Identifying Busy Tablets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1291&quot;&gt;#1291&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1296&quot;&gt;#1296&lt;/a&gt; Log busy tablets by ingest and query at
configurable intervals for better hot-spot detection using new properties
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/1.10/accumulo_user_manual#_tserver_log_busy_tablets_count&quot;&gt;tserver.log.busy.tablets.count&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tserver-startup-and-shutdown-protections&quot;&gt;TServer Startup and Shutdown Protections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1158&quot;&gt;#1158&lt;/a&gt; Require a configurable number of servers to be online, up to a
max wait time, before assignments begin on startup
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/1.10/accumulo_user_manual#_master_startup_tserver_avail_min_count&quot;&gt;master.startup.tserver.avail.min.count&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/1.10/accumulo_user_manual#_master_startup_tserver_avail_max_wait&quot;&gt;master.startup.tserver.avail.max.wait&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1456&quot;&gt;#1456&lt;/a&gt; Throttle the number of shutdown requests sent to tservers to
prevent cluster self-destruction and give time for triage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-metrics&quot;&gt;New Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/accumulo/issues/1406&quot;&gt;#1406&lt;/a&gt; Add GC cycle metrics (file and wal collection) to be reported
via the hadoop2 metrics. This exposes the gc cycle metrics available in the
monitor to external metrics systems and includes run time for the new gc post
operation (compact, flush)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Enable with new property, &lt;a href=&quot;/1.10/accumulo_user_manual#_gc_metrics_enabled&quot;&gt;gc.metrics.enabled&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcCandidates&lt;/code&gt; - number of candidates for GC&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcDeleted&lt;/code&gt; - number of candidates deleted&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcErrors&lt;/code&gt; - number of deletion errors&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcFinished&lt;/code&gt; - timestamp of GC cycle finished&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcInUse&lt;/code&gt; - number of candidates still in use&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcPostOpDuration&lt;/code&gt; - duration of compact / flush&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcRunCycleCount&lt;/code&gt; - 1-up cycle count&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcStarted&lt;/code&gt; - timestamp of GC cycle start&lt;/li&gt;

          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcWalErrors&lt;/code&gt; - number of errors during WAL deletion&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcWalFinished&lt;/code&gt; - timestamp of WAL collection completion&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcWalInUse&lt;/code&gt; - number of WALs in use&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AccGcWalStarted&lt;/code&gt; - timestamp of WAL collection start&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
