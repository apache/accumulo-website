<div class="alert alert-warning" style="margin-bottom: 0px;" role="alert">
  <p>This version of Accumulo has been superceded by a newer version.</p>
  <p>Please check <a class="alert-link" href="/release/">our release archive</a> for a newer version.</p>
</div>




<p>Apache Accumulo 1.7.0 is a significant release that includes many important
milestone features which expand the functionality of Accumulo. These include
features related to security, availability, and extensibility. Nearly 700 JIRA
issues were resolved in this version. Approximately two-thirds were bugs and
one-third were improvements.</p>

<p>Below are resources for this release:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/1.7/accumulo_user_manual.html">User Manual</a></li>
  <li><a href="/1.7/apidocs">Javadocs</a></li>
  <li><a href="/1.7/examples">Examples</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In the context of Accumulo’s <a href="http://semver.org">Semantic Versioning</a> <a href="https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/1.7.0/README.md#api">guidelines</a>,
this is a “minor version”. This means that new APIs have been created, some
deprecations may have been added, but no deprecated APIs have been removed.
Code written against 1.6.x should work against 1.7.0, likely binary-compatible
but definitely source-compatible. As always, the Accumulo developers take API compatibility
very seriously and have invested much time to ensure that we meet the promises set forth to our users.</p>

<h1 id="major-changes">Major Changes</h1>

<h2 id="updated-minimum-requirements">Updated Minimum Requirements</h2>

<p>Apache Accumulo 1.7.0 comes with an updated set of minimum requirements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Java7 is required. Java6 support is dropped.</li>
  <li>Hadoop 2.2.0 or greater is required. Hadoop 1.x support is dropped.</li>
  <li>ZooKeeper 3.4.x or greater is required.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="client-authentication-with-kerberos">Client Authentication with Kerberos</h2>

<p>Kerberos is the de-facto means to provide strong authentication across Hadoop
and other related components. Kerberos requires a centralized key distribution
center to authentication users who have credentials provided by an
administrator. When Hadoop is configured for use with Kerberos, all users must
provide Kerberos credentials to interact with the filesystem, launch YARN
jobs, or even view certain web pages.</p>

<p>While Accumulo has long supported operating on Kerberos-enabled HDFS, it still
required Accumulo users to use password-based authentication to authenticate
with Accumulo. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-2815">ACCUMULO-2815</a> added support for allowing
Accumulo clients to use the same Kerberos credentials to authenticate to
Accumulo that they would use to authenticate to other Hadoop components,
instead of a separate user name and password just for Accumulo.</p>

<p>This authentication leverages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Authentication_and_Security_Layer">Simple Authentication and Security Layer
(SASL)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_Security_Services_Application_Program_Interface">GSSAPI</a> to support Kerberos authentication over the
existing Apache Thrift-based RPC infrastructure that Accumulo employs.</p>

<p>These additions represent a significant forward step for Accumulo, bringing
its client-authentication up to speed with the rest of the Hadoop ecosystem.
This results in a much more cohesive authentication story for Accumulo that
resonates with the battle-tested cell-level security and authorization model
already familiar to Accumulo users.</p>

<p>More information on configuration, administration, and application of Kerberos
client authentication can be found in the <a href="/1.7/accumulo_user_manual#_kerberos">Kerberos chapter</a> of the
Accumulo User Manual.</p>

<h2 id="data-center-replication">Data-Center Replication</h2>

<p>In previous releases, Accumulo only operated within the constraints of a
single installation. Because single instances of Accumulo often consist of
many nodes and Accumulo’s design scales (near) linearly across many nodes, it
is typical that one Accumulo is run per physical installation or data-center.
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-378">ACCUMULO-378</a> introduces support in Accumulo to automatically
copy data from one Accumulo instance to another.</p>

<p>This data-center replication feature is primarily applicable to users wishing
to implement a disaster recovery strategy. Data can be automatically copied
from a primary instance to one or more other Accumulo instances. In contrast
to normal Accumulo operation, in which ingest and query are strongly
consistent, data-center replication is a lazy, eventually consistent
operation. This is desirable for replication, as it prevents additional
latency for ingest operations on the primary instance. Additionally, the
implementation of this feature can sustain prolonged outages between the
primary instance and replicas without any administrative overhead.</p>

<p>The Accumulo User Manual contains a <a href="/1.7/accumulo_user_manual#_replication">new chapter on replication</a>
which details the design and implementation of the feature, explains how users
can configure replication, and describes special cases to consider when
choosing to integrate the feature into a user application.</p>

<h2 id="user-initiated-compaction-strategies">User-Initiated Compaction Strategies</h2>

<p>Per-table compaction strategies were added in 1.6.0 to provide custom logic to
decide which files are involved in a major compaction. In 1.7.0, the ability
to specify a compaction strategy for a user-initiated compaction was added in
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1798">ACCUMULO-1798</a>. This allows surgical compactions on a subset
of tablet files. Previously, a user-initiated compaction would compact all
files in a tablet.</p>

<p>In the Java API, this new feature can be accessed in the following way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Connection conn = ...
CompactionStrategyConfig csConfig = new CompactionStrategyConfig(strategyClassName).setOptions(strategyOpts);
CompactionConfig compactionConfig = new CompactionConfig().setCompactionStrategy(csConfig);
connector.tableOperations().compact(tableName, compactionConfig)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3134">ACCUMULO-3134</a>, the shell’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">compact</code> command was modified
to enable selecting which files to compact based on size, name, and path.
Options were also added to the shell’s compaction command to allow setting
RFile options for the compaction output. Setting the output options could be
useful for testing. For example, one tablet to be compacted using snappy
compression.</p>

<p>The following is an example shell command that compacts all files less than
10MB, if the tablet has at least two files that meet this criteria. If a
tablet had a 100MB, 50MB, 7MB, and 5MB file then the 7MB and 5MB files would
be compacted. If a tablet had a 100MB and 5MB file, then nothing would be done
because there are not at least two files meeting the selection criteria.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>compact -t foo --min-files 2 --sf-lt-esize 10M
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The following is an example shell command that compacts all bulk imported
files in a table.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>compact -t foo --sf-ename I.*
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These provided convenience options to select files execute using a specialized
compaction strategy. Options were also added to the shell to specify an
arbitrary compaction strategy. The option to specify an arbitrary compaction
strategy is mutually exclusive with the file selection and file creation
options, since those options are unique to the specialized compaction strategy
provided. See <code class="highlighter-rouge">compact --help</code> in the shell for the available options.</p>

<h2 id="api-clarification">API Clarification</h2>

<p>The declared API in 1.6.x was incomplete. Some important classes like
ColumnVisibility were not declared as Accumulo API. Significant work was done
under <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3657">ACCUMULO-3657</a> to correct the API statement and clean up
the API to be representative of all classes which users are intended to
interact with. The expanded and simplified API statement is in the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/1.7.0/README.md#api">README</a>.</p>

<p>In some places in the API, non-API types were used. Ideally, public API
members would only use public API types. A tool called <a href="http://code.revelc.net/apilyzer-maven-plugin">APILyzer</a>
was created to find all API members that used non-API types. Many of the
violations found by this tool were deprecated to clearly communicate that a
non-API type was used. One example is a public API method that returned a
class called <code class="highlighter-rouge">KeyExtent</code>. <code class="highlighter-rouge">KeyExtent</code> was never intended to be in the public
API because it contains code related to Accumulo internals. <code class="highlighter-rouge">KeyExtent</code> and
the API methods returning it have since been deprecated. These were replaced
with a new class for identifying tablets that does not expose internals.
Deprecating a type like this from the API makes the API more stable while also
making it easier for contributors to change Accumulo internals without
impacting the API.</p>

<p>The changes in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3657">ACCUMULO-3657</a> also included an Accumulo API
regular expression for use with checkstyle. Starting with 1.7.0, projects
building on Accumulo can use this checkstyle rule to ensure they are only
using Accumulo’s public API. The regular expression can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/apache/accumulo/blob/1.7.0/README.md#api">README</a>.</p>

<h1 id="performance-improvements">Performance Improvements</h1>

<h2 id="configurable-threadpool-size-for-assignments">Configurable Threadpool Size for Assignments</h2>

<p>During start-up, the Master quickly assigns tablets to Tablet Servers. However,
Tablet Servers load those assigned tablets one at a time. In 1.7, the servers
will be more aggressive, and will load tablets in parallel, so long as they do
not have mutations that need to be recovered.</p>

<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1085">ACCUMULO-1085</a> allows the size of the threadpool used in the Tablet Servers 
for assignment processing to be configurable.</p>

<h2 id="group-commit-threshold-as-a-factor-of-data-size">Group-Commit Threshold as a Factor of Data Size</h2>

<p>When ingesting data into Accumulo, the majority of time is spent in the
write-ahead log. As such, this is a common place that optimizations are added.
One optimization is known as “group-commit”. When multiple clients are
writing data to the same Accumulo tablet, it is not efficient for each of them
to synchronize the WAL, flush their updates to disk for durability, and then
release the lock. The idea of group-commit is that multiple writers can queue
the write for their mutations to the WAL and then wait for a sync that will
satisfy the durability constraints of their batch of updates. This has a
drastic improvement on performance, since many threads writing batches
concurrently can “share” the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">fsync</code>.</p>

<p>In previous versions, Accumulo controlled the frequency in which this
group-commit sync was performed as a factor of the number of clients writing
to Accumulo. This was both confusing to correctly configure and also
encouraged sub-par performance with few write threads.
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1950">ACCUMULO-1950</a> introduced a new configuration property
<code class="highlighter-rouge">tserver.total.mutation.queue.max</code> which defines the amount of data that is
queued before a group-commit is performed in such a way that is agnostic of
the number of writers. This new configuration property is much easier to
reason about than the previous (now deprecated) <code class="highlighter-rouge">tserver.mutation.queue.max</code>.
Users who have set <code class="highlighter-rouge">tserver.mutation.queue.max</code> in the past are encouraged
to start using the new <code class="highlighter-rouge">tserver.total.mutation.queue.max</code> property.</p>

<h1 id="other-improvements">Other improvements</h1>

<h2 id="balancing-groups-of-tablets">Balancing Groups of Tablets</h2>

<p>By default, Accumulo evenly spreads each table’s tablets across a cluster. In
some situations, it is advantageous for query or ingest to evenly spreads
groups of tablets within a table. For <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3439">ACCUMULO-3439</a>, a new
balancer was added to evenly spread groups of tablets to optimize performance.
This <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/accumulo/entry/balancing_groups_of_tablets">blog post</a> provides more details about when and why
users may desire to leverage this feature..</p>

<h2 id="user-specified-durability">User-specified Durability</h2>

<p>Accumulo constantly tries to balance durability with performance. Guaranteeing
durability of every write to Accumulo is very difficult in a
massively-concurrent environment that requires high throughput. One common
area of focus is the write-ahead log, since it must eventually call <code class="highlighter-rouge">fsync</code> on
the local filesystem to guarantee that data written is durable in the face of
unexpected power failures. In some cases where durability can be sacrificed,
either due to the nature of the data itself or redundant power supplies,
ingest performance improvements can be attained.</p>

<p>Prior to 1.7, a user could only configure the level of durability for
individual tables. With the implementation of <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1957">ACCUMULO-1957</a>,
the durability can be specified by the user when creating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">BatchWriter</code>,
giving users control over durability at the level of the individual writes.
Every <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mutation</code> written using that <code class="highlighter-rouge">BatchWriter</code> will be written with the
provided durability. This can result in substantially faster ingest rates when
the durability can be relaxed.</p>

<h2 id="waitforbalance-api">waitForBalance API</h2>

<p>When creating a new Accumulo table, the next step is typically adding splits
to that table before starting ingest. This can be extremely important since a
table without any splits will only be hosted on a single tablet server and
create a ingest bottleneck until the table begins to naturally split. Adding
many splits before ingesting will ensure that a table is distributed across
many servers and result in high throughput when ingest first starts.</p>

<p>Adding splits to a table has long been a synchronous operation, but the
assignment of those splits was asynchronous. A large number of splits could be
processed, but it was not guaranteed that they would be evenly distributed
resulting in the same problem as having an insufficient number of splits.
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-2998">ACCUMULO-2998</a> adds a new method to <code class="highlighter-rouge">InstanceOperations</code> which
allows users to wait for all tablets to be balanced. This method lets users
wait until tablets are appropriately distributed so that ingest can be run at
full-bore immediately.</p>

<h2 id="hadoop-metrics2-support">Hadoop Metrics2 Support</h2>

<p>Accumulo has long had its own metrics system implemented using Java MBeans.
This enabled metrics to be reported by Accumulo services, but consumption by
other systems often required use of an additional tool like jmxtrans to read
the metrics from the MBeans and send them to some other system.</p>

<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-1817">ACCUMULO-1817</a> replaces this custom metrics system Accumulo
with Hadoop Metrics2. Metrics2 has a number of benefits, the most common of
which is invalidating the need for an additional process to send metrics to
common metrics storage and visualization tools. With Metrics2 support,
Accumulo can send its metrics to common tools like Ganglia and Graphite.</p>

<p>For more information on enabling Hadoop Metrics2, see the <a href="/1.7/accumulo_user_manual#_metrics">Metrics
Chapter</a> in the Accumulo User Manual.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-tracing-with-htrace">Distributed Tracing with HTrace</h2>

<p>HTrace has recently started gaining traction as a standalone project,
especially with its adoption in HDFS. Accumulo has long had distributed
tracing support via its own “Cloudtrace” library, but this wasn’t intended for
use outside of Accumulo.</p>

<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-898">ACCUMULO-898</a> replaces Accumulo’s Cloudtrace code with HTrace.
This has the benefit of adding timings (spans) from HDFS into Accumulo spans
automatically.</p>

<p>Users who inspect traces via the Accumulo Monitor (or another system) will begin
to see timings from HDFS during operations like Major and Minor compactions when
running with at least Apache Hadoop 2.6.0.</p>

<h2 id="versions-file-present-in-binary-distribution">VERSIONS file present in binary distribution</h2>

<p>In the pre-built binary distribution or distributions built by users from the
official source release, users will now see a <code class="highlighter-rouge">VERSIONS</code> file present in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">lib/</code> directory alongside the Accumulo server-side jars. Because the created
tarball strips off versions from the jar file names, it can require extra work
to actually find what the version of each dependent jar (typically inspecting
the jar’s manifest).</p>

<p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-2863">ACCUMULO-2863</a> adds a <code class="highlighter-rouge">VERSIONS</code> file to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">lib/</code> directory
which contains the Maven groupId, artifactId, and verison (GAV) information for
each jar file included in the distribution.</p>

<h2 id="per-table-volume-chooser">Per-Table Volume Chooser</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">VolumeChooser</code> interface is a server-side extension point that allows user
tables to provide custom logic in choosing where its files are written when
multiple HDFS instances are available. By default, a randomized volume chooser
implementation is used to evenly balance files across all HDFS instances.</p>

<p>Previously, this VolumeChooser logic was instance-wide which meant that it would
affect all tables. This is potentially undesirable as it might unintentionally
impact other users in a multi-tenant system. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3177">ACCUMULO-3177</a>
introduces a new per-table property which supports configuration of a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">VolumeChooser</code>. This ensures that the implementation to choose how HDFS
utilization happens when multiple are available is limited to the expected
subset of all tables.</p>

<h2 id="table-and-namespace-custom-properties">Table and namespace custom properties</h2>

<p>In order to avoid errors caused by mis-typed configuration properties, Accumulo was strict about which configuration properties 
could be set. However, this prevented users from setting arbitrary properties that could be used by custom balancers, compaction 
strategies, volume choosers, and iterators. Under <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-2841">ACCUMULO-2841</a>, the ability to set arbitrary table and 
namespace properties was added. The properties need to be prefixed with <code class="highlighter-rouge">table.custom.</code>.  The changes made in 
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3177">ACCUMULO-3177</a> and <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3439">ACCUMULO-3439</a> leverage this new feature.</p>

<h1 id="notable-bug-fixes">Notable Bug Fixes</h1>

<h2 id="sourceswitchingiterator-deadlock">SourceSwitchingIterator Deadlock</h2>

<p>An instance of SourceSwitchingIterator, the Accumulo iterator which
transparently manages whether data for a tablet read from memory (the
in-memory map) or disk (HDFS after a minor compaction), was found deadlocked
in a production system.</p>

<p>This deadlock prevented the scan and the minor compaction from ever
successfully completing without restarting the tablet server.
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3745">ACCUMULO-3745</a> fixes the inconsistent synchronization inside
of the SourceSwitchingIterator to prevent this deadlock from happening in the
future.</p>

<p>The only mitigation of this bug was to restart the tablet server that is
deadlocked.</p>

<h2 id="table-flush-blocked-indefinitely">Table flush blocked indefinitely</h2>

<p>While running the Accumulo RandomWalk distributed test, it was observed that
all activity in Accumulo had stopped and there was an offline Accumulo
metadata table tablet. The system first tried to flush a user tablet, but the
metadata table was not online (likely due to the agitation process which stops
and starts Accumulo processes during the test). After this call, a call to
load the metadata tablet was queued but could not complete until the previous
flush call. Thus, a deadlock occurred.</p>

<p>This deadlock happened because the synchronous flush call could not complete
before the load tablet call completed, but the load tablet call couldn’t run
because of connection caching we perform in Accumulo’s RPC layer to reduce the
quantity of sockets we need to create to send data.
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-3597">ACCUMULO-3597</a> prevents this deadlock by forcing the use of a
non-cached connection for the RPC message requesting a metadata tablet to be
loaded.</p>

<p>While this feature does result in additional network resources to be used, the
concern is minimal because the number of metadata tablets is typically very
small with respect to the total number of tablets in the system.</p>

<p>The only mitigation of this bug was to restart the tablet server that is hung.</p>

<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>

<p>Each unit and functional test only runs on a single node, while the RandomWalk
and Continuous Ingest tests run on any number of nodes. <em>Agitation</em> refers to
randomly restarting Accumulo processes and Hadoop DataNode processes, and, in
HDFS High-Availability instances, forcing NameNode fail-over.</p>

<p>During testing, multiple Accumulo developers noticed some stability issues
with HDFS using Apache Hadoop 2.6.0 when restarting Accumulo processes and
HDFS datanodes. The developers investigated these issues as a part of the
normal release testing procedures, but were unable to find a definitive cause
of these failures. Users are encouraged to follow
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-2388">ACCUMULO-2388</a> if they wish to follow any future developments.
One possible workaround is to increase the <code class="highlighter-rouge">general.rpc.timeout</code> in the
Accumulo configuration from <code class="highlighter-rouge">120s</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">240s</code>.</p>
