The Accumulo Access library provides the same functionality, semantics, and syntax as the
Accumulo ColumnVisibility and VisibilityEvaluator classes in a standalone java library
that can be used separately from Accumulo.

The Accumulo Access project can be found on [GitHub][github]. In addition to the source
code this project includes a specification of the AccessExpression syntax, an example
application, a JMH benchmark, and an ANTLRv4 grammar file and example. Releases of
Accumulo Access can be found on the [download][download] site.
