## Upgrading from 1.10.x or 2.0.x to 2.1

The recommended way to upgrade from a prior 1.10.x or 2.0.x release is to stop Accumulo, upgrade
to 2.1 and then start 2.1. To upgrade from a release prior to 1.10, follow the
[below steps](#upgrading-from-189-to-20) to upgrade to 2.0 and then perform the upgrade to 2.1. A
direct upgrade from releases prior to 1.10 has not been tested.

### Rename master Properties, Config Files, and Script References

Although not required until at least release 3.0, it is strongly recommended as a part of the
upgrade to rename any properties in `accumulo.properties` (or properties specified on the command
line) starting with `master.`. `master` should be replaced with `manager`.

Any reference to `master` in other scripts (e.g., invoking `accumulo-service master` from an init
script) should be renamed to `manager` (`accumulo-service manager` for the previous example).

If the manager is not started using the provided `accumulo-cluster` or `accumulo-service` scripts,
then a one-time upgrade step will need to be performed. Run the `RenameMasterDirInZK` utility
after installing 2.1 but before starting it.
```
${ACCUMULO_HOME}/bin/accumulo org.apache.accumulo.manager.upgrade.RenameMasterDirInZK
```

### Create new cluster configuration file

The `accumulo-cluster` script now uses a single file that defines the location of the managers,
tservers, etc. You can create this file using the command `accumulo-cluster create-config`. You
will then need to transfer the contents of the current individual files to this new consolidated file.

### Encrypted Instances

**Warning**: Upgrading a previously encrypted instance is not supported as the implementation
and properties have changed.

## Upgrading from 1.8/9 to 2.0

Follow the steps below to upgrade your Accumulo instance and client to 2.0.

### Upgrade Accumulo instance

**IMPORTANT!** Before upgrading to Accumulo 2.0, you will need to upgrade to Java 8 and Hadoop 3.x.

Upgrading to Accumulo 2.0 is done by stopping Accumulo 1.8/9 and starting Accumulo 2.0.

Before stopping Accumulo 1.8/9, install Accumulo 2.0 and configure it by following the [2.0 quick start]({% durl getting-started/quickstart %}).

There are several changes to scripts and configuration in 2.0 so be careful when using configuration or automated setup designed for 1.8/9.
Below are some changes in 2.0 that you should be aware of:
* `accumulo.properties` has replaced `accumulo-site.xml`. You can either convert `accumulo-site.xml` by hand
  from XML to properties or use the following Accumulo command.
  ```
  accumulo convert-config -x old/accumulo-site.xml -p new/accumulo.properties
  ```
* The following [server properties]({% durl configuration/server-properties %}) were deprecated for 2.0:
   * {% plink general.classpaths %}
   * {% plink tserver.metadata.readahead.concurrent.max %}
   * {% plink tserver.readahead.concurrent.max  %}
* `accumulo-client.properties` has replaced `client.conf`. The [client properties]({% durl configuration/client-properties %})
  in the new file are different so take care when customizing.
* `accumulo-cluster` script has replaced the `start-all.sh` & `stop-all.sh` scripts.
   - Default host files (i.e `masters`, `monitor`, `gc`) are no longer in `conf/` directory of tarball but can be created using `accumulo-cluster create-config`
   - Tablet server hosts must be listed in a `tservers` file instead of a `slaves` file. To minimize confusion, Accumulo will not start if the old `slaves` file is present.
* `accumulo-service` script can be used to start/stop Accumulo services (i.e master, tablet server, monitor) on a single node.
    - Can be used even if Accumulo was started using `accumulo-cluster` script.
* `accumulo-env.sh` constructs environment variables (such as `JAVA_OPTS` and `CLASSPATH`) used when running Accumulo processes
    - This file was used in Accumulo 1.x but has changed significantly for 2.0
    - Environment variables (such as `$cmd`, `$bin`, `$conf`) are set before `accumulo-env.sh` is loaded and can be used to customize environment.
    - The `JAVA_OPTS` variable is constructed in `accumulo-env.sh` to pass command-line arguments to the `java` command that the starts Accumulo processes
      (i.e. `java $JAVA_OPTS main.class.for.$cmd`).
    - The `CLASSPATH` variable sets the Java classpath used when running Accumulo processes. It can be modified to upgrade dependencies or use vendor-specific
      distributions of Hadoop.
* Logging is configured in `accumulo-env.sh` for Accumulo processes. The following log4j configuration files in the `conf/` directory will be used if
  `accumulo-env.sh` is not modified. These files can be modified to turn on/off logging for Accumulo processes:
    - `log4j-service.properties` for all Accumulo services (except monitor)
    - `logj4-monitor.properties` for Accumulo monitor
    - `log4j.properties` for Accumulo clients and commands
* MapReduce jobs that read/write from Accumulo [must configure their dependencies differently]({% durl development/mapreduce#configure-dependencies-for-your-mapreduce-job %}).
* Run the command `accumulo shell` to access the shell using configuration in `conf/accumulo-client.properties`

When your Accumulo 2.0 installation is properly configured, stop Accumulo 1.8/9 and start Accumulo 2.0:

```
./accumulo-1.9.3/bin/stop-all.sh
./accumulo-2.0.1/bin/accumulo-cluster start
```
It is recommended that users test this upgrade on development or test clusters before attempting it on production clusters.

### Upgrade Accumulo clients

There several client API changes in 2.0. In most cases, new API was introduced and the old API was only deprecated. While it is recommended
that users start using the new API, the old API will continue to be supported through 2.x.

Below is a list of client API changes that users are required to make for 2.0:

* Update your pom.xml use Accumulo 2.0. Also, update any Hadoop & ZooKeeper dependencies in your pom.xml to match the versions running on your cluster.
  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.accumulo</groupId>
    <artifactId>accumulo-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
  </dependency>
  ```
* ClientConfiguration objects can no longer be created using `new ClientConfiguration()`.
   * Use `ClientConfiguration.create()` instead
* Some API deprecated in 1.x releases was dropped
* Aggregators have been removed

Below is a list of recommended client API changes:

* The API for [creating Accumulo clients]({% durl getting-started/clients#creating-an-accumulo-client %}) has changed in 2.0.
  * The old API using [ZooKeeperInstance], [Connector], [Instance], and [ClientConfiguration] has been deprecated.
  * [Connector] objects can be created from an [AccumuloClient] object using [Connector.from()]
* Accumulo's [MapReduce API]({% durl development/mapreduce %}) has changed in 2.0.
  * A new API has been introduced in the `org.apache.accumulo.hadoop` package of the `accumulo-hadoop-mapreduce` jar.
  * The old API in the `org.apache.accumulo.core.client` package of the `accumulo-core` has been deprecated and will
    eventually be removed.
  * For both the old and new API, you must [configure dependencies differently]({% durl development/mapreduce#configure-dependencies-for-your-mapreduce-job %})
    when creating your MapReduce job.

## Upgrading from 1.7 to 1.8

Upgrades from 1.7 to 1.8 are possible with little effort as no changes were made at the data layer and RPC changes were made in a backwards-compatible way. The recommended way is to stop Accumulo 1.7, perform the Accumulo upgrade to 1.8, and then start 1.8. Like previous versions, after 1.8 is started on a 1.7 instance, a one-time upgrade will happen by the Master which will prevent a downgrade back to 1.7. Upgrades are still one way. Upgrades from versions prior to 1.7 to 1.8 should follow the below path to 1.7 and then perform the upgrade to 1.8 – direct upgrades to 1.8 for versions other than 1.7 are untested.

Existing configuration files from 1.7 should be compared against the examples provided in 1.8. The 1.7 configuration files should all function with 1.8 code, but you will likely want to include changes found in the 1.8.0 release notes and these release notes for 1.8.1.

For upgrades from prior to 1.7, follow the upgrade instructions to 1.7 first.

## Upgrading from 1.7.x to 1.7.y

The recommended way to upgrade from a prior 1.7.x release is to stop Accumulo, upgrade to 1.7.y and then start 1.7.y.

When upgrading, there is a known issue if the upgrade fails due to outstanding [FATE] operations, see [ACCUMULO-4496] The workaround if this situation is encountered:

- Start tservers
- Start shell
- Run ```fate print``` to list all
- If completed, just delete with ```fate delete```
- Start masters once there are no more fate operations

If any of the FATE operations are not complete, you should rollback the upgrade and troubleshoot completing them with your prior version. When performing an upgrade between major versions, the upgrade is one-way, therefore it is important that you do not have any outstanding FATE operations before starting the upgrade.

## Upgrading from 1.6 to 1.7

Upgrades from 1.6 to 1.7 are possible with little effort as no changes were made at the data layer and RPC changes were made in a backwards-compatible way. The recommended way is to stop Accumulo 1.6, perform the Accumulo upgrade to 1.7, and then start 1.7. Like previous versions, after 1.7.0 is started on a 1.6 instance, a one-time upgrade will happen by the Master which will prevent a downgrade back to 1.6. Upgrades are still one way. Upgrades from versions prior to 1.6 to 1.7 should follow the below path to 1.6 and then perform the upgrade to 1.7 – direct upgrades to 1.7 for versions other than 1.6 are untested.

After upgrading to 1.7.0, users will notice the addition of a replication table in the accumulo namespace. This table is created and put offline to avoid any additional maintenance if the data-center replication feature is not in use.

Existing configuration files from 1.6 should be compared against the examples provided in 1.7. The 1.6 configuration files should all function with 1.7 code, but you will likely want to include a new file (hadoop-metrics2-accumulo.properties) to enable the new metrics subsystem. Read the section on Hadoop Metrics2 in the Administration chapter of the Accumulo User Manual.

For each of the other new features, new configuration properties exist to support the feature. Refer to the added sections in the User Manual for the feature for information on how to properly configure and use the new functionality.

## Upgrading from 1.5 to 1.6

This happens automatically the first time Accumulo 1.6 is started.

If your instance previously upgraded from 1.4 to 1.5, you must verify that your
1.5 instance has no outstanding local write ahead logs. You can do this by ensuring
either:

- All of your tables are online and the Monitor shows all tablets hosted
- The directory for write ahead logs (logger.dir.walog) from 1.4 has no files remaining
    on any tablet server / logger hosts

To upgrade from 1.5 to 1.6 you must:

- Verify that there are no outstanding FATE operations
    - Under 1.5 you can list what's in FATE by running
      ```$ACCUMULO_HOME/bin/accumulo org.apache.accumulo.server.fate.Admin print```
    - Note that operations in any state will prevent an upgrade. It is safe
      to delete operations with status SUCCESSFUL. For others, you should restart
      your 1.5 cluster and allow them to finish.
- Stop the 1.5 instance.
- Configure 1.6 to use the hdfs directory and zookeepers that 1.5 was using.
- Copy other 1.5 configuration options as needed.
-  Start Accumulo 1.6.

  The upgrade process must make changes to Accumulo's internal state in both ZooKeeper and
  the table metadata. This process may take some time if Tablet Servers have to go through
  recovery. During this time, the Monitor will claim that the Master is down and some
  services may send the Monitor log messages about failure to communicate with each other.
  These messages are safe to ignore. If you need detail on the upgrade's progress you should
  view the local logs on the Tablet Servers and active Master.

## Upgrading from 1.4 to 1.6

To upgrade from 1.4 to 1.6 you must perform a manual initial step.

Prior to upgrading you must:

- Verify that there are no outstanding FATE operations
  - Under 1.4 you can list what's in FATE by running ```$ACCUMULO_HOME/bin/accumulo org.apache.accumulo.server.fate.Admin print```
  - Note that operations in any state will prevent an upgrade. It is safe to delete operations with status SUCCESSFUL. For others,
      you should restart your 1.4 cluster and allow them to finish.
- Stop the 1.4 instance.
- Configure 1.6 to use the hdfs directory, walog directories, and zookeepers that 1.4 was using.
- Copy other 1.4 configuration options as needed.

Prior to starting the 1.6 instance you will need to run the LocalWALRecovery tool on each node that previously ran an instance of the Logger role.

```
$ACCUMULO_HOME/bin/accumulo org.apache.accumulo.tserver.log.LocalWALRecovery
```

The recovery tool will rewrite the 1.4 write ahead logs into a format that 1.6 can read. After this step has completed on all nodes, start the 1.6 cluster to continue the upgrade.

The upgrade process must make changes to Accumulo's internal state in both ZooKeeper and the table metadata. This process may take some time if Tablet Servers have to go through recovery. During this time, the Monitor will claim that the Master is down and some services may send the Monitor log messages about failure to communicate with each other. While the upgrade is in progress, the Garbage Collector may complain about invalid paths. The Master may also complain about failure to create the trace table because it already exists. These messages are safe to ignore. If other error messages occur, you should seek out support before continuing to use Accumulo. If you need detail on the upgrade's progress you should view the local logs on the Tablet Servers and active Master.

Note that the LocalWALRecovery tool does not delete the local files. Once you confirm that 1.6 is successfully running, you should delete these files on the local filesystem.

## Upgrading from 1.4 to 1.5

This happens automatically the first time Accumulo 1.5 is started.

- Stop the 1.4 instance.
- Configure 1.5 to use the hdfs directory, walog directories, and zookeepers
  that 1.4 was using.
- Copy other 1.4 configuration options as needed.
- Start Accumulo 1.5.
