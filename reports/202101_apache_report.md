[DRAFT][REPORT] Apache Accumulo - January 2021

## Description:

The Apache Accumulo sorted, distributed key/value store is a robust, scalable,
high performance data storage system that features cell-based access control
and customizable server-side processing. It is based on Google's BigTable
design and is built on top of Apache Hadoop, Zookeeper, and Thrift.

## Issues:

The owner of http://www.accumulodata.com no longer has access to the email used to register the 
domain, and the registrar will not accept communications from alternate accounts.  Currently, the 
domain is set to expire on 2021-06-28, and without access by the owner, should automatically expire.
The Accumulo PMC is currently trying to determine if other actions are required. Initial emails are 
at [1] and follow-up discussions at [4].
