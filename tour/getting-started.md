title: Getting Started
---

First make sure you have Java, Maven and Git installed on your machine.  Oh you are already rocking? OK let's go!

1. Clone the tour onto your machine:
```commandline
git clone -b tour https://github.com/apache/accumulo-website.git tour
cd tour
```
2. Open [Main.java] in your favorite editor.
```commandline
vim ./src/main/java/tour/Main.java
```
Notice the main method creates a MiniAccumuloCluster with a root password of "tourguide".  MiniAccumuloCluster is a mini
version of Accumulo that runs on your local filesystem.  It should only be used for development purposes but will work
great here on the tour.  Files and logs used by MiniAccumuloCluster can be seen in the _target/mac######_ directory. 

3. Modify the _exercise_ method to print a hello message. You will put your code in this method for each lesson.
```java
private static void exercise(MiniAccumuloCluster mac) {
    // start writing your code here
    System.out.println("Hello world");
}
```
4. Build and run to make sure everything is cool.
```commandline
mvn -q clean compile exec:java
```
