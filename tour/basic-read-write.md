title: Writing and Reading
---
Accumulo is a big key/value store.  Writing data to Accumulo is flexible and fast.  Like any database, Accumulo stores
data in tables and rows.  Each row in an Accumulo table can hold many key/value pairs. Our next exercise shows how to
write and read from a table.

```java
static void exercise(MiniAccumuloCluster mac) {
    // Connect to Mini Accumulo as the root user and create a table called "GothamPD".
    Connector conn = mac.getConnector("root", "tourguide");
    conn.tableOperations().create("GothamPD");

    // Create a Mutation object to hold all changes to a row in a table.  Each row has a unique row ID.
    Mutation mutation = new Mutation("id0001");

    // Create key/value pairs for Batman.  Put them in the "hero" family.
    mutation.put("hero","alias", "Batman");
    mutation.put("hero","name", "Bruce Wayne");
    mutation.put("hero","wearsCape?", "true");

    // Create a BatchWriter to the GothamPD table and add your mutation to it. Try w/ resources will close for us.
    try (BatchWriter writer = conn.createBatchWriter("GothamPD", new BatchWriterConfig())) {
        writer.addMutation(mutation);
    }

    // Read and print all rows of the "GothamPD" table. Try w/ resources will close for us.
    try (Scanner scan = conn.createScanner("GothamPD", Authorizations.EMPTY)) {
        System.out.println("Gotham Police Department Persons of Interest:");
        // A Scanner is an extension of java.lang.Iterable so behaves just like one.
        for (Map.Entry<Key, Value> entry : scan) {
            System.out.printf("Key : %-50s  Value : %s\n", entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

Copy this code into your `exercise` method and run it using the command below.

```commandline
mvn -q clean compile exec:java
``` 

Good job! That is all it takes to write and read from Accumulo.

Notice a lot of other information was printed from the Keys we created. Accumulo is flexible because hidden within its 
[Key] is a rich data model that can be broken up into different parts.  We will cover the [Data Model][dmodel] in the next lesson.

### But wait... I thought Accumulo was all about Security?

Spoiler Alert: it is!  Did you notice the `Authorizations.EMPTY` we passed in when creating a [Scanner]?  The data
we created in this first lesson was not secured with Authorizations so the Scanner didn't require any Authorizations 
to read it.  More to come later in the [Authorizations][auths] lesson! 

[dmodel]: /tour/data-model
[auths]: /tour/authorizations
[Key]: {% jurl org.apache.accumulo.core.data.Key %}
[Scanner]: {% jurl org.apache.accumulo.core.client.Scanner %}
