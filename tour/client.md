title: Connecting to Accumulo
---

Connecting to a live instance of Accumulo is done through the [AccumuloClient] object.  This object
contains a live connection to Accumulo and will remain open until closed.  All client operations
can be accessed from this one object.

The [Accumulo] entry point is used to create a client by calling ```Accumulo.newClient()```.  The
client can be created from properties by using one of the ```from()``` methods or using the
```to()``` and ```as()``` methods to specify the connection information directly. A later example
will illustrate how to create a new client.

For the tour, you will use the ```client``` provided by the JShell to perform the required operations.
The properties used to create the client can be viewed in the file contained in the `clientPropUrl`
variable.

```commandline
jshell> /vars
|    URL clientPropUrl = file:<path_to_accumulo-client.properties file>
```

Let's start by using table operations to list the default tables and instance operations to get
the instance ID.

```commandline
jshell> client.tableOperations().list().forEach(System.out::println);
accumulo.metadata
accumulo.replication
accumulo.root
```

Now let's retrieve the instance ID.

```commandline
jshell> System.out.println(client.instanceOperations().getInstanceID());
8b9839f7-cdc6-44ca-b527-43db45acc79f
```

Different types of operations are accessed by their respective methods on the client:

* client.tableOperations();
* client.namespaceOperations();
* client.securityOperations();
* client.instanceOperations();
* client.replicationOperations();


The client is also used to create Scanners and perform batch operations.  These will be
explored later.
