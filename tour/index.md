Welcome to the Accumulo tour! The tour offers a hands-on introduction to the [Accumulo Java API](/api),
broken down into independent steps and exercises. The exercises give you a chance to apply what you have
learned by writing code on your own. The answers to an exercise are typically provided in the next step.
The tour begins at the [Getting Started][start] page.

When on a tour page, the left and right keys on the keyboard can be used to navigate. If you have any
questions or suggestions while going through the tour, please email our [mailing list][mlist] or 
[create an issue][issue]. 

This version works interactively making use of the JShell feature of Java. It is designed to work on 
versions of Accumulo 2.1.x or greater.
