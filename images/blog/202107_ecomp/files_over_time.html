    <p>Below are animated gifs from four random tablets in the ci table showing
how their files changed during the ingest phase of the test. While the test was
running the ecomp and file columns from the metadata table were dumped to a
file every 60 seconds. The dump file name included a timestamp. This file name
is included in the animated gif. This can help one correlate the animated gifs
with the plots.  Blips related for the ecomp column can be seen when external
compactions ran. The animated gifs run at 24 frames per second with each frame
presenting the data captured in a minute, so each second of the gif shows 24
minutes of captured data. Each gif is approximately 60 seconds long.</p>
