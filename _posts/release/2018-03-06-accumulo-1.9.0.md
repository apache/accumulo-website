```

* [ACCUMULO-1972] - fix Range constructor

```
ACCUMULO-1972 fix Range constructor
    
    Updated Range constructor to use a private implementation of
    beforeStartKey, so that it does not cause a problem if a subclass
    overrides the public beforeStartKey method.
    
    (commit message updated by ctubbsii to provide additional detail)
```

* [ACCUMULO-4506] - Add a timeout to a replication RPC call

```
[ACCUMULO-4506] Add a timeout to a replication RPC call
    
    This addresses an issue where a replication task will get stuck for a
    substantial amount of time.  Using a timeout for the client will abandon
    the task after 2m (default) for a single RPC attempt.  Note that this is
    related to the replication.work.attempts property, as a client timeout
    will be retried by the same task up to this number of times before being
    abandoned entirely.
```

* [ACCUMULO-4528] - Add import/export table info to docs (#350)

```
ACCUMULO-4528 Add import/export table info to docs (#350)
    
    Updated 1.8 and 2.0 user manual documentation to include the import/export example within the
    documentation directly rather than requiring a user to click away from the manual pages to a
    different project (i.e., the accumulo-examples project) for that information.

ACCUMULO-4555 Removes parsing of version string in Version class
    
    This fix removes the extraneous parsing code, constructors, and methods
    from the Version class, keeping only the KeywordExecutable portions.
    Updated Accumulo class as well removing dependency on Version class.
    Removes old TestVersion unit test based on PR feedback.

commit #1: ACCUMULO-4585 Fix bootstrap_config memory profiles

    sort buffer, and map memory usage fits into the configured memory for
    the JVM in the 512MB profile
    
    Also tweak the sort buffer for the 2GB profile so it falls somewhere
    between that of the 1GB and 3GB profile.

commit #1: ACCUMULO-4657 - backport to 1.7
commit #2: ACCUMULO-4657 Update MetadataTableUtil.java
    
    Outputting every "loaded" entry in the table is excessive, especially for tables with multiple simultaneous bulk imports and multiple references to the same file.  This has been seen to cause performance problems.  Even when the log level was reduced, there was blocking within log4j.  By doing that check once outside the loop and only logging at trace level, we have seen bulk import performance improvements.

ACCUMULO-4665 Use UGI with real Kerberos credentials
    
    UGI supports the notion of users without credentials being
    "proxied" (riding on top of) another user which does have
    credentials. This is authorized via configuration. These
    changes allow this scenario more naturally and remove
    unnecessarily strict assertions in KerberosToken.

commit #4: ACCUMULO-4685 Remove more warnings
    
    Fix some more obscure warnings by ensuring type safety when using
    collections methods which take "Object" instead of the expected type.
    This prevents coding problems masked by the fact that a generic
    Collection can never contain objects which aren't of the type in that
    Collection.
    
    Avoid use of unsafe (non-commutative) equals implementations which can
    compare "apples with apple seeds". For example:
      new Value(b = new byte[]{...}).equals(b)
    or
      new ProcessReference(p = new Process(...)).equals(p)
    
    Remove some unnecessary casts of char to int.

commit #1: ACCUMULO-4779 fixed classpath context config performance issue (#358)
commit #2: ACCUMULO-4779 Avoid locks in ZooCache when data in cache
    
    ZooCache was using read and write locks.  For the case where lots
    of threads were accessing data present in the cache the read locks
    were really slowing things down.  This commit switches to immutable
    copies of all the data present in the cache which require no locks
    to access.  When the cache changes the immutable copies are
    regenerated and then made available.

commit #1: ACCUMULO-4805 Obtain filemanager lock once when opening files (#380)
    
    Before this change the lock on the file manager was obtained F+1 times, where
    F is the number of files.  When there are lots of threads this is a lot of
    contention.  In this change, the lock is only obtained once.
    
    Also in this change the file managers semaphore was switched to non-fair.  The
    fair semaphore is expensive and can cause contention.

commit #1: ACCUMULO-4847 Fix Retry utility's API (#399)
    
    Create a builder API for Retry and RetryFactory, so that the parameters
    (which all have the same type) cannot be easily confused for one another
    and cause "sleep-until-heat-death-of-the-universe" bugs.
    
    Also fix a minor bug which is caused by the assumption that nanoTime is
    always positive. It is normal for nanoTime to be negative, only the
    differences between two times is guaranteed to be positive.
