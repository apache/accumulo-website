title: Apache Accumulo 1.9.0
draft: true
---

Apache Accumulo 1.9.0 is a minor release on the 1.x branch. This release would be considered a
maintainence release on 1.8 branch except there are some API additions which resulted in a new minor
release. Users of 1.8.x versions of Accumulo should upgrade to 1.9.0.  There will be no more bug fix
releases on the 1.8 branch. This release contains changes from 96 issues.  See [GitHub] and [JIRA]
for a list of changes.

Below are resources for this release:

* [User Manual][user_manual] - In-depth developer and administrator documentation.
* [Javadocs][javadoc] - Accumulo 1.9.0 API
* [Examples][examples] - Code with corresponding readme files that give step by step instructions
  for running example code.

## Notable Changes

### Deprecated ClientConfiguration API using commons config

In [ACCUMULO-4611], public API in ClientConfiguration using commons config types was deprecated to
better support Hadoop 3 in the future. New methods were added to replace these methods which cause
this release to be a 1.9.0 release.  These changes allow removal of commons config from Accumulo's 
API in 2.0.0.  If using ClientConfiguration, then switching from existing constructors to the new
static methods [create()], [fromFile()], or [fromMap()] will ensure your code works in 2.0.0.

### Performance Improvements

Accumulo was profiled while running lots of concurrent small scans. During this excercise these
performance bugs were found and fixed: [#378], [ACCUMULO-4778], [ACCUMULO-4779], [ACCUMULO-4781],
[ACCUMULO-4782], [ACCUMULO-4788], [ACCUMULO-4789], [ACCUMULO-4790], [ACCUMULO-4797], 
[ACCUMULO-4798], [ACCUMULO-4799], [ACCUMULO-4800], [ACCUMULO-4801], [ACCUMULO-4805], and [ACCUMULO-4809]  

Below are other significant performance improvements in 1.9.0 :

* [ACCUMULO-4636] - System iterator performance improvements
* [ACCUMULO-4657] - Avoided expensive BulkImport logging
* [ACCUMULO-4667] - Avoided unnecessary recomputation in LocalityGroupIterator
* [#410] - Fixed inefficient auths check

### Fixed upgrade process to set version on all volumes

During upgrades, only one volume in a multiple HDFS volume was updated with the correct version. This would cause all tablet servers
to complain and ultimately fail. [ACCUMULO-4686] fixes this by setting the version on all volumes.

### Updated Accumulo to work with new releases of Guava

In [ACCUMULO-4702], dependencies on Beta-annotated Guava classes and methods were removed. While Accumulo still
includes Guava 14 in its tarball, it will work with newer versions of Guava in client code. It has been tested to work
with Guava 23.

### Updated RFile to prevent very large blocks

RFiles now use windowed statistics ([ACCUMULO-4669]) to prevent very large blocks.  In 1.8.0 a bug was introduced that
caused RFile data block sizes to grow very large in the case where key sizes slowly increased.  This could lead
to degraded query performance or out of memory exceptions on tablet servers.

## Other Notable Changes

* [#403] - Enabled more metrics reporting
* [ACCUMULO-4528] - Add import/export table info to docs
* [ACCUMULO-4643] - Allow iterators to yield
* [ACCUMULO-4655] - Added a Response Time column to the monitor
* [ACCUMULO-4693] - Add process name to metrics
* [ACCUMULO-4721] - Document rfile-info in the user manual
