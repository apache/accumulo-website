title: Apache Accumulo 1.7.4
draft: true
---

Apache Accumulo 1.7.4 is a maintenance release on the 1.7 version branch. This release contains changes from 46 issues, comprised of bug-fixes, 
performance improvements, build quality improvements, and more. See [Jira][JIRA_174] or the bottom of this page for a complete list.

Below are resources for this release:

* [User Manual][user_manual] - In-depth developer and administrator documentation.
* [Javadocs][javadoc] - Accumulo 1.7.4 API
* [Examples][examples] - Code with corresponding readme files that give step by step instructions for running example code.

Accumulo follows [Semantic Versioning][semver] [guidelines][guidelines].  This release is a  “[patch version][patch_version]”, which means that
only backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced in this version. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior. Users
of any previous 1.7.x release are strongly encouraged to update as soon as possible to benefit from the  bug fixes with very little concern in change
of underlying functionality.  As always, the Accumulo developers take API compatibility very seriously and have invested much time to ensure that we
meet the promises set forth to our users. Users of 1.6 or earlier that are seeking to upgrade to 1.7 should consider 1.7.4 as a starting point.

## Major Changes

### Fixed upgrade process to set version on all volumes

During upgrades, only one volume in a multiple HDFS volume was updated with the correct version. This would cause all tablet servers
to complain and ultimately fail. [ACCUMULO-4686] fixes this by setting the version on all volumes.

### Updated Accumulo to work with new releases of Guava

In [ACCUMULO-4702], dependencies on Beta-annotated Guava classes and methods were removed. While Accumulo still
includes Guava 14 in its tarball, it will work with newer versions of Guava in client code. It has been tested to work
with Guava 23.

### Updated RFile to prevent very large blocks

RFiles now use windowed statistics ([ACCUMULO-4669]) to prevent very large blocks.  In 1.7.3 a bug was introduced that
caused RFile data block sizes to grow very large in the case where key sizes slowly increased.  This could lead
to degraded query performance or out of memory exceptions on tablet servers.

## Notable Changes

* [ACCUMULO-4506] - Add a timeout to a replication RPC call
* [ACCUMULO-4619] - Add splits hung forever
* [ACCUMULO-4633] - Added check to prevent division by zero
* [ACCUMULO-4640] - Accumulo shell is expecting instance.volumens in client.conf instead of accumulo-site.xml
* [ACCUMULO-4657] - BulkImport Performance Bottleneck
* [ACCUMULO-4665] - Must use the "real" user for RPCs when Kerberos is enabled
* [ACCUMULO-4676] - Use HTTPOnly flags in monitor to prevent XSS attacks
* [ACCUMULO-4776] - Fix advertised host in monitor
* [ACCUMULO-4777] - Root tablet got spammed with 1.8 million log entries
* [ACCUMULO-4787] - Close input stream in AccumuloReplicaSystem
* [ACCUMULO-4809] - Avoid blocking during session clean up
* [ACCUMULO-4817] - Update build plugins and parent POM
