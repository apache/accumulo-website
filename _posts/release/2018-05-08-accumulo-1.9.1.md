title: Apache Accumulo 1.9.1
draft: true
---

Accumulo 1.9.1 contains multiple bug fixes for write ahead log recovery. Write
ahead log recovery is the process of restoring data that was in memory when a
tablet server died. These bugs could lead to data loss and are present in
1.8.0, 1.8.1, and 1.9.0.  Because the bugs can negatively impact Accumulo's
metadata table, even users that mainly use bulk import may be affected.  It is
recommended that anyone using 1.8.0 or greater upgrade immediately.  For more
information see issues [#441] and [#449].  These issues were fixed in pull
request [#443] and [#458].
