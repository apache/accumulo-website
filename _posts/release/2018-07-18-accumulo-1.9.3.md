## Notable Changes

### Multiple Fixes for Write Ahead Logs

This release fixes a number of issues with Write Ahead Logs that slow or prevent recovery and in 
some cases could lead to data loss. The fixes reduce the number of WALS needed to referenced by 
a tserver, and improve error handing of WAL issues.

+ [2c2840b18](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/commit/2c2840b1873282354fffad2d76774fd31cc2fd41):
  Fix race condition when getting WALs for dead tserver (#866)   Eliminates a race condition that 
could result in data loss during recovery if, during recovery, the GC deletes unreferenced WAL files
simultaneously as the master is attempting to create a list of wals needed for recovery. If that
happened, the master could skip files that should have been included in the recovery, resulting in
data loss. 

+ [fae5fb29a](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/commit/fae5fb29a5b6bec07914364b41a24a77934d2aa6): 
Fix improper handling of new WAL failure [#949] [#1005] [#1057]  Fixes issues where a wal that 
does not exist (create failed or was deleted by a tserver) but the reference was created in 
zookeeper. The reference to the non-existent wal causes metadata operations to hang until reference
is removed.

+ Fix Unreferenced closed WALs that were never written to [#823] [#845] Fixes issue where failures
could result in the creation of many files with a header and no data. Recovery treated these 
as an "empty" files during recovery.

+ Handle many tablets referencing many WALs [#854] [#860] Reduces the number of wals that a tserver
references, this speeds recovery by reducing the number of wals needed during recovery. When a the
number of wals referenced by a tserver exceeds a threshold, the tserver will flush and minor 
compactthe oldest log to limit the number of wal references.   

+ [577dd9a64](https://github.com/apache/accumulo/commit/577dd9a643574b79700ed3de076eb84f9d4d8124) - During tablet recovery filter logs out that do not define tablet. (#881)   

+ Fix WAL RecoveryLogReader error on failed file [#961] [#1048] If a tserver fails sorting, a marker 
file is written to the recovery directory. The presence of this marker prevented any subsequent 
attempts at recovery from succeeding. 
(originally [ACCUMULO-4861](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACCUMULO-4861) 

### Multiple Fixes for Compaction Issues

 
### Fix ArrayOutOfBounds error when new files are created (affects all previous versions)

Accumulo maintains a 1-up counter to keep file names and other identifiers
unique. This counter is padded with 0 characters when used in file names. If
the counter becomes sufficiently large, the padding code in versions prior to
1.9.3 causes an out of bounds error.

Most users will not be affected by this bug, since it requires the counter to
be very large before the error would be seen. Situations which might cause the
counter to get very large include: having a very old Accumulo cluster that has
been running for many years, having a very large cluster, having a cluster that
writes many files very quickly for long periods of time, having altered the
current value of the counter in ZooKeeper, or if you experience a bug which
causes the counter value to skip ahead very rapidly.

If you wish to check to see if you are at risk of being impacted by this bug,
examine the name of RFiles recently created in your system. If you have one or
more padded 0 characters (after an initial letter), as in I000zy98.rf or
I0123abc.rf, you are probably at low risk from this bug.

This issue was fixed in pull request [#562]

### Stop locking during compaction

Compactions were acquiring the tablet lock between each key value. 
This created unnecessary contention with other operations like scan and 
bulk imports.  For {% ghi 1031 %} the the synchronization was removed
by [#1032]. 

### Fixed splitting tablets with files and no data

The split code assumed that if a tablet had files that it had data in
those files.  There are some edge case where this is not true.  Updated
the split code to handle this [#998] [#999].

### Log when a scan waits a long time for files.

Accumulo has a configurable limit on the max number of files open in a
tserver for all scans.  When too many files are open, scans must wait.
In [#978] and [#981] scans that wait too long for files now log a message.

### Fixed race condition in table existence check.

The Accumulo client code that checks if tables exists had a race 
condition.  The race was fixed in [#768] and [#973]

### Support running Mini Accumulo using Java 11

Mini Accumulo made some assumptions about classloaders that were no 
longer true in Java 11.  This caused Mini to fail in Java 11.  In 
[#924] Mini was updated to work with Java 11, while still working
with Java 7 and 8.

### Fixed issue with improperly configured Snappy

If snappy was configured for a table and the snappy libraries were not 
available on the system then this could cause minor compactions to hang
forever.  In [#920] and [#925] this was fixed and minor 
compactions will proceed when a different compression is configured.

### Handle bad locality group config.

Improperly configured locality groups could cause a tablet to become
inoperative.  This was fixed in [#819] and [#840].

### Fixed bulk import race condition.

There was a race condition in bulk import that could result in files
being imported after a bulk import transaction had completed.  In the
worst case these files were already compacted and garbage collected. 
This would cause a tablet to have a reference to a file that did not 
exists.  No data would have been lost, but it would cause scans to fail.
The race was fixed in [#800] and [#837]
