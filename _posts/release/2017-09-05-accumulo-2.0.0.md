title: Apache Accumulo 2.0.0
draft: true
---

## Major Changes

[ACCUMULO-4726] - Replaced the ability to use `Value.equals(byte[])` to check
if the contents of a `Value` object was equal to a given byte array. To perform
that check, you must now use the newly added `Value.contentEquals(byte[])`
method. This corrects the behavior of the `equals` method so that it conforms
to the API contract documented in the javadoc inherited from its superclass.
However, it will break any code that was relying on the undocumented and broken
behavior to compare `Value` objects with byte arrays. Such comparisons will now
always return `false` instead of `true`, even if the contents are equal.

## Other Notable Changes
[ACCUMULO-3652] - Replaced string concatenation in log statements with slf4j
where applicable. Removed tserver TLevel logging class.
