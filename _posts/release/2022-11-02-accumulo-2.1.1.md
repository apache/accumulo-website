## About

Apache Accumulo 2.1.1 is a patch release of the 2.1.0 LTM line. 

### Major Improvements

### Minor Improvements

* {% ghi 3077 %}, {% ghi 3079 %} Avoid filling OS file caches by setting the
  `FSDataOutputStream.setDropBehind` flag when performing likely one-time file
  accesses, as with WAL files and major compaction input files. This should allow
  files that might benefit more from caching to stay in the cache longer.
* {% ghi 3023 %}, {% ghi 3053 %} Prevent excessive logging when an ExternalCompaction
  is cancelled for cause and around the ThreadPools
* {% ghi 3057 %} Modified Monitor to direct DataTable errors to console

### Behavior Changes

* {% ghi 3082 %} ScanServers can now scan offline tables. The AccumuloClient will no longer
  throw a TableOfflineException when creating a Scanner or BatchScanner against an offline table.
  Instead, an error will be thrown on the call to iterator() if it can't be scanned because it is offline.

### Bug Fixes

* {% ghi 3059 %} Removed stale compactions from CompactionCoordinator internal structure. The
  CompactionCoordinator has an internal data structure where it keeps track of running compactions. Running
  compactions were not being removed from this set in some edge cases so they continued to be shown on the
  Monitor when in reality the compaction was not running. This occured in testing when the Compactor process
  was killed by the agitator. The compaction was rescheduled to run on a different Compactor, the issue here
  was just orphaned information in the data structure being shown in the Monitor.
* {% ghi 3048 %} Output time strings on the monitor using the correct user locale (also made them more concise)
