## About

Apache Accumulo 2.1.1 is a patch release of the 2.1.0 LTM line. 

### Major Improvements

### Minor Improvements

* {% ghi 3077 %}, {% ghi 3079 %}, {% ghi 3083 %} Avoid filling OS page cache by setting the
  `FSDataOutputStream.setDropBehind` flag when performing likely one-time file
  accesses, as with WAL input and output files and major compaction input files. This should allow
  files that might benefit more from caching to stay in the cache longer. {% ghi 3083 %}
  introduces a new property, table.compaction.major.output.drop.cache, for dropping pages
  from the OS page cache for major compaction output files. These changes will only have an
  impact on HDFS FileSystem implementations and operating systems that support them.
* {% ghi 3023 %}, {% ghi 3053 %} Prevent excessive logging when an ExternalCompaction
  is cancelled for cause and around the ThreadPools
* {% ghi 3057 %} Modified Monitor to direct DataTable errors to console

### Bug Fixes

* {% ghi 3059 %} Removed stale compactions from CompactionCoordinator internal structure. The
  CompactionCoordinator has an internal data structure where it keeps track of running compactions. Running
  compactions were not being removed from this set in some edge cases so they continued to be shown on the
  Monitor when in reality the compaction was not running. This occured in testing when the Compactor process
  was killed by the agitator. The compaction was rescheduled to run on a different Compactor, the issue here
  was just orphaned information in the data structure being shown in the Monitor.
* {% ghi 3048 %} Output time strings on the monitor using the correct user locale (also made them more concise)
