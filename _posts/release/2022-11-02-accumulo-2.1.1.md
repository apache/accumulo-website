## About

Apache Accumulo 2.1.1 is a patch release of the 2.1.0 LTM line. 

### Major Improvements

### Minor Improvements

* {% ghi 3077 %}, {% ghi 3079 %}, {% ghi 3083 %}, {% ghi 3123 %} Avoid filling
  OS page cache by calling `setDropBehind` on the FSInputStream when
  performing likely one-time file accesses, as with WAL and compaction input
  and output files. This should allow files that might benefit more from
  caching to stay in the cache longer. {% ghi 3083 %} and {% ghi 3123 %}
  introduces new properties, table.compaction.major.output.drop.cache and 
  table.compaction.minor.output.drop.cache, for dropping pages from the OS
  page cache for compaction output files. These changes will only have an
  impact on HDFS FileSystem implementations and operating systems that support
  the underlying OS system call. See associated HDFS [issue][HDFS-16864]
  that will improve the underlying implementation when resolved.
* {% ghi 3023 %}, {% ghi 3053 %} Prevent excessive logging when an ExternalCompaction
  is cancelled for cause and around the ThreadPools
* {% ghi 3057 %} Modified Monitor to direct DataTable errors to console

### Bug Fixes

* {% ghi 3059 %} Removed stale compactions from CompactionCoordinator internal structure. The
  CompactionCoordinator has an internal data structure where it keeps track of running compactions. Running
  compactions were not being removed from this set in some edge cases so they continued to be shown on the
  Monitor when in reality the compaction was not running. This occured in testing when the Compactor process
  was killed by the agitator. The compaction was rescheduled to run on a different Compactor, the issue here
  was just orphaned information in the data structure being shown in the Monitor.
* {% ghi 3048 %} Output time strings on the monitor using the correct user locale (also made them more concise)
