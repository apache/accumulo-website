** DRAFT RELEASE NOTES **

## Notable Changes

### Compaction Changes

Significant changes were made to how Accumulo compacts files in this release.  See 
{% dlink administration/compaction %} for details, below are some highlights.

 * Multiple concurrent compactions per tablet on disjoint files is now
   supported.  Previously only a single compaction could run on a tablet.  This
   allows tablets that are running long compactions on large files to
   concurrently compact new smaller files that arrive.
 * Multiple compaction thread pools per tablet server are now supported.
   Previously only a single thread pool existed within a tablet server for
   compactions.  With a single thread pool, if all threads are working on long
   compactions it can starve quick compactions.  Now compactions with little
   data can be processed by dedicated thread pools.
 * Accumulo's default algorithm for selecting files to compact was modified to
   select the smallest set of files that meet the compaction ratio criteria
   instead of the largest set.  This change makes tablets more aggressive about
   reducing their number files while still doing logarithmic compaction work.
   This change also enables efficiently compacting new small files that arrive
   during a long running compaction. 
 * Having dedicated compaction threads pools for tables is now supported
   through configuration.  The default configuration for Accumulo sets up
   dedicated thread pools for compacting the Accumulo metadata table.
 * Merging minor compactions were dropped.  These were added to Accumulo to
   address the problem of new files arriving while a long running compaction
   was running.  Merging minor compactions could cause O(N^2) compaction work.
   The new compaction changes in this release can satisfy this use case while
   doing a logarithmic amount of work.

CompactionStrategy was deprecated in favor of new public APIs.
See its [javadoc]({% jurl org.apache.accumulo.tserver.compaction.CompactionStrategy %}) 
for more information.

### Fixed GC Metadata hotspots

Prior to this release, Accumulo stored GC file candidates in the metadata table
using rows of the form `~del<URI>`. This row schema lead to uneven load on
the metadata table and metadata tablets that were eventually never used. In {%
ghi 1043 %} the row format was changed to `~del<hash(URI)><URI>` resulting in
even load on the metadata table and even data spread in the tablets. After
upgrading, there may still be splits in the metadata table using the old row
format. These splits can be merged away as shown in the example below which
starts off with splits generated from the old and new row schema. The old
splits with the prefix `~delhdfs` are merged away.

```
root@uno> getsplits -t accumulo.metadata 
2<
~
~del55
~dela7
~delhdfs://localhost:8020/accumulo/tables/2/default_tablet/F00000a0.rf
~delhdfs://localhost:8020/accumulo/tables/2/default_tablet/F00000kb.rf
root@uno> merge -t accumulo.metadata -b ~delhdfs -e ~delhdfs~
root@uno> getsplits -t accumulo.metadata
