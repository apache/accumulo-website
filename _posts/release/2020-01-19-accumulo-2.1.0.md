** DRAFT RELEASE NOTES **

## Binary Incompatibility

This release is known to be incompatible with prior versions of the client
libraries. That is, the 2.0.0 or 2.0.1 version of the client libraries will not
be able to communicate with a 2.1.0 or later installaction of Accumulo, nor will
the 2.1.0 or later version of the client libraries communicate with a 2.0.1 or
earlier installation.

## Notable Changes

### Compaction Changes

Significant changes were made to how Accumulo compacts files in this release.  See 
{% dlink administration/compaction %} for details, below are some highlights.

 * Multiple concurrent compactions per tablet on disjoint files is now
   supported.  Previously only a single compaction could run on a tablet.  This
   allows tablets that are running long compactions on large files to
   concurrently compact new smaller files that arrive.
 * Multiple compaction thread pools per tablet server are now supported.
   Previously only a single thread pool existed within a tablet server for
   compactions.  With a single thread pool, if all threads are working on long
   compactions it can starve quick compactions.  Now compactions with little
   data can be processed by dedicated thread pools.
 * Accumulo's default algorithm for selecting files to compact was modified to
   select the smallest set of files that meet the compaction ratio criteria
   instead of the largest set.  This change makes tablets more aggressive about
   reducing their number files while still doing logarithmic compaction work.
   This change also enables efficiently compacting new small files that arrive
   during a long running compaction. 
 * Having dedicated compaction threads pools for tables is now supported
   through configuration.  The default configuration for Accumulo sets up
   dedicated thread pools for compacting the Accumulo metadata table.
 * Merging minor compactions were dropped.  These were added to Accumulo to
   address the problem of new files arriving while a long running compaction
   was running.  Merging minor compactions could cause O(N^2) compaction work.
   The new compaction changes in this release can satisfy this use case while
   doing a logarithmic amount of work.

CompactionStrategy was deprecated in favor of new public APIs.
See its [javadoc]({% jurl org.apache.accumulo.tserver.compaction.CompactionStrategy %}) 
for more information.

### Fixed GC Metadata hotspots

Prior to this release, Accumulo stored GC file candidates in the metadata table
using rows of the form `~del<URI>`. This row schema lead to uneven load on
the metadata table and metadata tablets that were eventually never used. In {%
ghi 1043 %} the row format was changed to `~del<hash(URI)><URI>` resulting in
even load on the metadata table and even data spread in the tablets. After
upgrading, there may still be splits in the metadata table using the old row
format. These splits can be merged away as shown in the example below which
starts off with splits generated from the old and new row schema. The old
splits with the prefix `~delhdfs` are merged away.

```
root@uno> getsplits -t accumulo.metadata 
2<
~
~del55
~dela7
~delhdfs://localhost:8020/accumulo/tables/2/default_tablet/F00000a0.rf
~delhdfs://localhost:8020/accumulo/tables/2/default_tablet/F00000kb.rf
root@uno> merge -t accumulo.metadata -b ~delhdfs -e ~delhdfs~
root@uno> getsplits -t accumulo.metadata 
2<
~
~del55
~dela7
```

### Master Renamed to Manager

In order to support more inclusive language in our code, the Accumulo team has
renamed all references to the word "master" to "manager" (with the exception
of deprecated classes and packages retained for compatibility). This change
includes the master process, configuration properties with master in the name,
utilities with master in the name, and packages/classes in the code base. Where
these changes affect the public API, the deprecated "master" name will still be
supported until at least Accumulo 3.0.

  > **Important**
  One particular change to be aware of is that certain state for the manager
  process is stored in ZooKeeper, previously in under a directory named
  `masters`. This directory has been renamed to `managers`, and the upgrade
  will happen automatically if you launch Accumulo using the provided scripts.
  However, if you do not use the built in scripts (e.g., accumulo-cluster or
  accumulo-service), then you will need to perform a one-time upgrade of the
  ZooKeeper state by executing the `RenameMasterDirInZK` utility:
  ```
  ${ACCUMULO_HOME}/bin/accumulo org.apache.accumulo.manager.upgrade.RenameMasterDirInZK
  ```

Some other specific examples of these changes include:

* All configuration properties starting with `master.` have been renamed to
  start with `manager.` instead. The `master.*` property names in the site
  configuration file (or passed on the command-line) are converted internally
  to the new name, and a warning is printed. However, the old name can still be
  used until at least the 3.0 release of Accumulo. Any `master.*` properties
  that have been set in ZooKeeper will be automatically converted to the new
  `manager.*` name when Accumulo is upgraded. The old property names can still
  be used by the `config` shell command or via the methods accessible via
  `AccumuloClient`, but a warning will be generated when the old names are
  used. You are encouraged to update all references to `master` in your site
  configuration files to `manager` when installing Accumulo 2.1.
* The tablet balancers in the `org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer`
  package have all been relocated to `org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer`.
  DefaultLoadBalancer has been also renamed to SimpleLoadBalancer along with
  the move. The default balancer has been updated from
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.TableLoadBalancer` to
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.TableLoadBalancer`, and the
  default per-table balancer has been updated from
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.DefaultLoadBalancer` to
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.SimpleLoadBalancer`. If you have
  customized the tablet balancer configuration, you are strongly encouraged to
  update your configuration to reference the updated balancer names. If you
  written a custom tablet balancer, it should be updated to implement the new
  interface `org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.TabletBalancer`
  rather than extending the deprecated abstract
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.TabletBalancer`.
* The configuration file `masters` for identifying the manager host(s) has been
  deprecated. If this file is found, a warning will be printed. The replacement
  file `managers` should be used (i.e., rename your masters file to managers)
  instead.
* The `master` argument to the `accumulo-service` script has been deprecated,
  and the replacement `manager` argument should be used instead.
* The `-master` argument to the `org.apache.accumulo.server.util.ZooZap`
  utility has been deprecated and the replacement `-manager` argument should be
  used instead.
* The `GetMasterStats` utility has been renamed to `GetManagerStats`.
* `org.apache.accumulo.master.state.SetGoalState` is deprecated, and any custom
  scripts that invoke this utility should be updated to call
  `org.apache.accumulo.manager.state.SetGoalState` instead.
* `masterMemory` in `minicluster.properties` has been deprecated and
  `managerMemory` should be used instead in any `minicluster.properties` files
  you have configured.
