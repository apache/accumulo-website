** DRAFT RELEASE NOTES **

## Notable Changes

### Fixed GC Metadata hotspots

Prior to this release, Accumulo stored GC file candidates in the metadata table
using the rows of the form `~del<URI>`.  This row schema lead to uneven load on
the metadata table and metadata tablets that were eventually never used.  In {%
ghi 1043 %} the row fromat was changed to `~del<hash(URI)><URI>` resulting in
even load on the metadata table and even data spread in the tablets.  After
upgrading, there may still be splits in the metadata table using the old row
format.  These splits can be merged away as shown in the example below which
starts of with splits generated from the old and new row schema.  The old
splits with the prefix `~delhdfs` are merged away.

```
root@uno> getsplits -t accumulo.metadata 
2<
~
~del55
~dela7
~delhdfs://localhost:8020/accumulo/tables/2/default_tablet/F00000a0.rf
~delhdfs://localhost:8020/accumulo/tables/2/default_tablet/F00000kb.rf
root@uno> merge -t accumulo.metadata -b ~delhdfs -e ~delhdfs~
root@uno> getsplits -t accumulo.metadata 
2<
~
~del55
~dela7
```
