## About

Apache Accumulo 2.1.0 brings many new features and updates since 1.10 and 2.0. The 2.1 release
series is an LTM series, and as such, is expected to receive stability-improving bugfixes, as
needed. This makes this series suitable for production environments where stability is preferable
over new features that might appear in subsequent non-LTM releases.

This release has received more than 1200 commits from over 50 contributors, including numerous
bugfixes, updates, and features.

## Minimum Requirements

This version of Accumulo requires at least Java 11 to run. Various Java 11 versions from different
distributors were used throughout its testing and development, so we expect it to work with any
standard OpenJDK-based Java distribution.

At least Hadoop 3 is required, though it is recommended to use a more recent version. Version 3.3
was used extensively during testing, but we have no specific knowledge that an earlier version of
Hadoop 3 will not work. Whichever major/minor version you use, it is recommended to use the latest
bugfix/patch version available. By default, our POM depends on 3.3.4.

During much of this release's development, ZooKeeper 3.5 was used as a minimum. However, that
version reach its end-of-life during development, and we do not recommend using end-of-life versions
of ZooKeeper. The latest bugfix version of 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 should also work fine. By default, our
POM depends on 3.8.0.

## Binary Incompatibility

This release is known to be incompatible with prior versions of the client libraries. That is, the
2.0.0 or 2.0.1 version of the client libraries will not be able to communicate with a 2.1.0 or later
installation of Accumulo, nor will the 2.1.0 or later version of the client libraries communicate
with a 2.0.1 or earlier installation.

## Major New Features

### Overhaul of Table Compactions

Significant changes were made to how Accumulo compacts files in this release. See
{% dlink administration/compaction %} for details, below are some highlights.

 * Multiple concurrent compactions per tablet on disjoint files is now supported.  Previously only a
   single compaction could run on a tablet.  This allows tablets that are running long compactions
   on large files to concurrently compact new smaller files that arrive.
 * Multiple compaction thread pools per tablet server are now supported. Previously only a single
   thread pool existed within a tablet server for compactions.  With a single thread pool, if all
   threads are working on long compactions it can starve quick compactions.  Now compactions with
   little data can be processed by dedicated thread pools.
 * Accumulo's default algorithm for selecting files to compact was modified to select the smallest
   set of files that meet the compaction ratio criteria instead of the largest set.  This change
   makes tablets more aggressive about reducing their number files while still doing logarithmic
   compaction work. This change also enables efficiently compacting new small files that arrive
   during a long running compaction.
 * Having dedicated compaction threads pools for tables is now supported through configuration.  The
   default configuration for Accumulo sets up dedicated thread pools for compacting the Accumulo
   metadata table.
 * Merging minor compactions were dropped.  These were added to Accumulo to address the problem of
   new files arriving while a long running compaction was running.  Merging minor compactions could
   cause O(N^2) compaction work. The new compaction changes in this release can satisfy this use
   case while doing a logarithmic amount of work.

CompactionStrategy was deprecated in favor of new public APIs. CompactionStrategy was never public
API as it used internal types and one of these types `FileRef` was removed in 2.1. Users who have
written a CompactionStrategy can replace `FileRef` with its replacement internal type
`StoredTabletFile` but this is not recommended. Since it is very likely that CompactionStrategy will
be removed in a future release, any work put into rewriting a CompactionStrategy will be lost. It is
recommended that users implement CompactionSelector, CompactionConfigurer, and CompactionPlanner
instead.  The new compaction changes in 2.1 introduce new algorithms for optimally scheduling
compactions across multiple thread pools, configuring a deprecated compaction strategy may result is
missing out on the benefits of these new algorithms.

See the [javadoc]({% jurl org.apache.accumulo.tserver.compaction.CompactionStrategy %}) for more
information.

GitHub tickets related to these changes: {% ghi 564 %} {% ghi 1605 %} {% ghi 1609 %} {% ghi 1649 %}

### External Compactions (experimental)

This feature includes two new optional server components, CompactionCoordinator and Compactor, that
enables the user to run major compactions outside of the TabletServer. See {% dlink
getting-started/design %}, {% dlink administration/compaction %}, and the External Compaction [blog
post][ext_comp_blog] for more information. This work was completed over many tickets, see the GitHub
[project][ext_comp_project] for the related issues. {% ghi 2096 %}

### Scan Servers (experimental)

This feature includes a new optional server component, Scan Server, that enables the user to run
scans outside of the TabletServer. See {% dlink getting-started/design %},
{% ghi 2411 %}, and {% ghi 2665 %} for more information. Importantly, users can utilize this
feature to avoid bogging down the TabletServer with long-running scans, slow iterators, etc.,
provided they are willing to tolerate eventual consistency.

### New Per-Table On-Disk Encryption (experimental)

On-disk encryption can now be configured on a per table basis as well as for the entire instance
(all tables). See {% dlink security/on-disk-encryption %} for more information.

### New jshell entry point

Created new "jshell" convenience entry point. Run `bin/accumulo jshell` to start up jshell,
preloaded with Accumulo classes imported and with an instance of AccumuloClient already created for
you to connect to Accumulo (assuming you have a client properties file on the class path)  {% ghi
1870 %} {% ghi 1910 %}

## Major Improvements

### Fixed GC Metadata hotspots

Prior to this release, Accumulo stored GC file candidates in the metadata table using rows of the
form `~del<URI>`. This row schema lead to uneven load on the metadata table and metadata tablets
that were eventually never used. In {% ghi 1043 %} / {% ghi 1344 %}, the row format was changed to
`~del<hash(URI)><URI>` resulting in even load on the metadata table and even data spread in the
tablets. After upgrading, there may still be splits in the metadata table using the old row format.
These splits can be merged away as shown in the example below which starts off with splits generated
from the old and new row schema. The old splits with the prefix `~delhdfs` are merged away.

```
root@uno> getsplits -t accumulo.metadata
2<
~
~del55
~dela7
~delhdfs://localhost:8020/accumulo/tables/2/default_tablet/F00000a0.rf
~delhdfs://localhost:8020/accumulo/tables/2/default_tablet/F00000kb.rf
root@uno> merge -t accumulo.metadata -b ~delhdfs -e ~delhdfs~
root@uno> getsplits -t accumulo.metadata
2<
~
~del55
~dela7
```

### Master Renamed to Manager

In order to use more inclusive language in our code, the Accumulo team has renamed all references to
the word "master" to "manager" (with the exception of deprecated classes and packages retained for
compatibility). This change includes the master server process, configuration properties with master
in the name, utilities with master in the name, and packages/classes in the code base. Where these
changes affect the public API, the deprecated "master" name will still be supported until Accumulo
3.0.

  > **Important**
  One particular change to be aware of is that certain state for the manager process is stored in
  ZooKeeper, previously in under a directory named `masters`. This directory has been renamed to
  `managers`, and the upgrade will happen automatically if you launch Accumulo using the provided
  scripts. However, if you do not use the built in scripts (e.g., accumulo-cluster or
  accumulo-service), then you will need to perform a one-time upgrade of the ZooKeeper state by
  executing the `RenameMasterDirInZK` utility:
  ```
  ${ACCUMULO_HOME}/bin/accumulo org.apache.accumulo.manager.upgrade.RenameMasterDirInZK
  ```

Some other specific examples of these changes include:

* All configuration properties starting with `master.` have been renamed to start with `manager.`
  instead. The `master.*` property names in the site configuration file (or passed on the
  command-line) are converted internally to the new name, and a warning is printed. However, the old
  name can still be used until at least the 3.0 release of Accumulo. Any `master.*` properties that
  have been set in ZooKeeper will be automatically converted to the new `manager.*` name when
  Accumulo is upgraded. The old property names can still be used by the `config` shell command or
  via the methods accessible via `AccumuloClient`, but a warning will be generated when the old
  names are used. You are encouraged to update all references to `master` in your site configuration
  files to `manager` when installing Accumulo 2.1.
* The tablet balancers in the `org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer` package have all been
  relocated to `org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer`. DefaultLoadBalancer has been also
  renamed to SimpleLoadBalancer along with the move. The default balancer has been updated from
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.TableLoadBalancer` to
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.TableLoadBalancer`, and the default per-table
  balancer has been updated from `org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.DefaultLoadBalancer` to
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.SimpleLoadBalancer`. If you have customized the
  tablet balancer configuration, you are strongly encouraged to update your configuration to
  reference the updated balancer names. If you have written a custom tablet balancer, it should be
  updated to implement the new interface
  `org.apache.accumulo.server.manager.balancer.TabletBalancer` rather than extending the deprecated
  abstract `org.apache.accumulo.server.master.balancer.TabletBalancer`.
* The configuration file `masters` for identifying the manager host(s) has been deprecated. If this
  file is found, a warning will be printed. The replacement file `managers` should be used (i.e.,
  rename your masters file to managers) instead.
* The `master` argument to the `accumulo-service` script has been deprecated, and the replacement
  `manager` argument should be used instead.
* The `-master` argument to the `org.apache.accumulo.server.util.ZooZap` utility has been deprecated
  and the replacement `-manager` argument should be used instead.
* The `GetMasterStats` utility has been renamed to `GetManagerStats`.
* `org.apache.accumulo.master.state.SetGoalState` is deprecated, and any custom scripts that invoke
  this utility should be updated to call `org.apache.accumulo.manager.state.SetGoalState` instead.
* `masterMemory` in `minicluster.properties` has been deprecated and `managerMemory` should be used
  instead in any `minicluster.properties` files you have configured.
* See also {% ghi 1640 %} {% ghi 1642 %} {% ghi 1703 %} {% ghi 1704 %} {% ghi 1873 %} {% ghi 1907 %}

### New Tracing Facility

HTrace support was removed in this release and has been replaced with [OpenTelemetry]
[opentelemetry_home]. Trace information will not be shown in the monitor. See comments in {% ghi
2259 %} for an example of how to configure Accumulo to emit traces to supported OpenTelemetry sinks.
{% ghi 2257 %}

### New Metrics Implementation

The Hadoop Metrics2 framework is no longer being used to emit metrics from Accumulo. Accumulo is now
using the [Micrometer][micrometer_home] framework. Metric name and type changes have been
documented in org.apache.accumulo.core.metrics.MetricsProducer, see the [javadoc]({% jurl
org.apache.accumulo.core.metrics.MetricsProducer %}) for more information. See comments in {% ghi
2305 %} for an example of how to configure Accumulo to emit metrics to supported Micrometer sinks.
{% ghi 1134 %}

### New SPI Package

A new Service Plugin Interface (SPI) package was created in the accumulo-core jar, at
[org.apache.accumulo.core.spi][spi], under which exists interfaces for the various pluggable
components. See {% ghi 1900 %} {% ghi 1905 %} {% ghi 1880 %} {% ghi 1891 %} {% ghi 1426 %}

## Minor Improvements

### New listtablets Shell Command

A new command was created for debugging called listtablets, that shows detailed tablet information
on a single line. This command aggregates data about a tablet such as status, location, size, number
of entries and HDFS directory name. It even shows the start and end rows of tablets, displaying them
in the same sorted order they are stored in the metadata. See example command output below. {% ghi
1317 %} {% ghi 1821 %}

```
root@uno> listtablets -t test_ingest -h

```

### New Utility for Generating Splits

A new command line utility was created to generate split points from 1 or more rfiles. One or more
HDFS directories can be given as well. The utility will iterate over all the files provided and
determine the proper split points based on either the size or number given. It uses Apache
Datasketches to get the split points from the data. {% ghi 2361 %} {% ghi 2368 %}

### New Option for Cloning Offline

Added option to leave cloned tables offline {% ghi 1474 %} {% ghi 1475 %}

### New Max Tablets Option in Bulk Import

The property `table.bulk.max.tablets` was created in new bulk import technique. This property acts
as a cluster performance failsafe to prevent a single ingested file from being distributed across
too much of a cluster. The value is enforced by the new bulk import technique and is the maximum
number of tablets allowed for one bulk import file. When this property is set, an error will be
thrown when the value is exceeded during a bulk import. {% ghi 1614 %}

### New Health Check Thread in TabletServer

A new thread was added to the tablet server to periodically verify tablet metadata. {% ghi 2320 %}
This thread also prints to the debug log how long it takes the tserver to scan the metadata table.
The property tserver.health.check.interval was added to control the frequency at which this health
check takes place. {% ghi 2583 %}

### New ability for user to define context classloaders

Deprecated the existing VFS ClassLoader for eventual removal and created a new mechanism for users
to load their own classloader implementations. The new VFS classloader and VFS context classloaders
are in a new [repo][vfs_system_classloader] and can now be specified using Java's own system
properties. Alternatively, one can set their own classloader (they always could do this). {% ghi
1747 %} {% ghi 1715 %}

Please reference the Known Issues section of the 2.0.1 release notes for an issue affecting the
VFSClassLoader.

### Change in uncaught Exception/Error handling in server-side threads

Consolidated and normalized thread pool and thread creation. All threads created through this code
path will have an UncaughtExceptionHandler attached to it that will log the fact that the Thread
encountered an uncaught Exception and is now dead. When an Error is encountered in a server process,
it will attempt to print a message to stderr then terminate the VM using Runtime.halt. On the client
side, the default UncaughtExceptionHandler will only log the Exception/Error in the client and does
not terminate the VM. Additionally, the user has the ability to set their own
UncaughtExceptionHandler implementation on the client. {% ghi 1808 %} {% ghi 1818 %} {% ghi 2554 %}

### Updated hash algorithm

With the default password Authenticator, Accumulo used to store password hashes using SHA-256 and
using custom code to add a salt. In this release, we now use Apache commons-codec to store password
hashes in the `crypt(3)` standard format. With this change, we've also defaulted to using the
stronger SHA-512. Existing stored password hashes (if upgrading from an earlier version of Accumulo)
will automatically be upgraded when users authenticate or change their passwords, and Accumulo will
log a warning if it detects any passwords have not been upgraded. {% ghi 1787 %} {% ghi 1788 %} {%
ghi 1798 %} {% ghi 1810 %}

### Various Performance improvements when deleting tables

* Make delete table operations cancel user compactions {% ghi 2030 %} {% ghi 2169 %}.
* Prevent compactions from starting when delete table is called {% ghi 2182 %} {% ghi 2240 %}.
* Added check to not flush when table is being deleted {% ghi 1887 %}.
* Added log message before waiting for deletes to finish {% ghi 1881 %}.
* Added code to stop user flush if table is being deleted {% ghi 1931 %}

### New Monitor Pages, Improvements & Features

* A page was added to the Monitor that lists the active compactions and the longest running active
  compaction. As an optimization, this page will only fetch data if a user loads the page and will
  only do so a maximum of once a minute. This optimization was also added for the Active Scans page,
  along with the addition of a "Fetched" column indicating when the data was retrieved.
* A new feature was added to the TabletServer page to help users identify which tservers are in
  recovery mode. When a tserver is recovering, its corresponding row in the TabletServer Status
  table will be highlighted.
* A new page was also created for External Compactions that allows users to see the progress of
  compactions and other details about ongoing compactions (see below).

{% ghi 2283 %} {% ghi 2294 %} {% ghi 2358 %} {% ghi 2663 %}

<img src="/images/release/ec-running2.png" alt="External Compactions" style="width:85%"/>

<img src="/images/release/ec-running-details.png" alt="External Compactions Details" style="width:85%"/>

### New tserver scan timeout property

The new property `tserver.scan.results.max.timeout` was added to allow configuration of the timeout.
A bug was discovered where tservers were running out of memory, partially due to this timeout being
so short. The default value is 1 second, but now it can be increased. It is the max time for the
thrift client handler to wait for scan results before timing out. {% ghi 2599 %} {% ghi 2598 %}

### Always choose volumes for new tablet files

In {% ghi 1389 %}, we changed the behavior of the VolumeChooser. It now runs any time a new file is
created. This means VolumeChooser decisions are no longer "sticky" for tablets. This allows tablets
to balance their files across multiple HDFS volumes, instead of the first selected. Now, only the
directory name is "sticky" for a tablet, but the volume is not. So, new files will appear in a
directory named the same on different volumes that the VolumeChooser selects.

### Iterators package is now public API

{% ghi 1390 %} {% ghi 1400 %} {% ghi 1411 %} We declared that the core.iterators package is public
API, so it will now follow the semver rules for public API.

### Better accumulo-gc memory usage

{% ghi 1543 %} {% ghi 1650 %} Switch from batching file candidates to delete based on the amount of
available memory, and instead use a fixed-size batching strategy. This allows the accumulo-gc to run
consistently using a batch size that is configurable by the user. The user is responsbile for
ensuring the process is given enough memory to accommodate the batch size they configure, but this
makes the process much more consistent and predictable.

### Log4j2

{% ghi 1528 %} {% ghi 1514 %} {% ghi 1515 %} {% ghi 1516 %} While we still use slf4j, we have
upgraded the default logger binding to log4j2, which comes with a bunch of features, such as dynamic
reconfiguration, colorized console logging, and more.

### Added forEach method to Scanner

{% ghi 1742 %} {% ghi 1765 %} We added a forEach method to Scanner objects, so you can easily
iterate over the results using a lambda / BiConsumer that accepts a key-value pair.

### New public API to set multiple properties atomically

{% ghi 2692 %} We added a new public API added to support setting multiple properties at once
atomically using a read-modify-write pattern. This is available for table, namespace, and system
properties, and is called `modifyProperties()`. This builds off a related change that allows us to
more efficiently store and properties in ZooKeeper, which also results in fewer ZooKeeper watches.

### Simplified cluster configuration

{% ghi 2138 %} {% ghi 2903 %} Modified the accumulo-cluster script to read the server locations from a single
file, cluster.yaml, in the conf directory instead of multiple files (tserver, manager, gc, etc.). Starting the new scan server and compactor server types is supported using this new file.  It also contains options for starting multiple Tablet and Scan Servers per host.

### Other notable changes

* {% ghi 1174 %} {% ghi 816 %} Abstract metadata and change root metadata schema
* {% ghi 1309 %} Explicitly prevent cloning metadata table to prevent poor user experience
