## Notable Changes

### Fixes for Critical WAL Data Loss Bugs (affects versions 1.8.0-1.9.0)

Accumulo 1.9.1 contains multiple bug fixes for write ahead log recovery. Write
ahead log recovery is the process of restoring data that was in memory when a
tablet server died. These bugs could lead to data loss and are present in
1.8.0, 1.8.1, and 1.9.0. Because the bugs can negatively impact Accumulo's
metadata table, **even users that mainly use bulk import may be affected**. It
is **strongly** recommended that anyone using 1.8.0 or greater upgrade
immediately. For more information see issues [#441] and [#449]. These issues
were fixed in pull request [#443] and [#458].

The only users who would not be affected by these bugs would be users already
running Accumulo without the recommended write-ahead logs enabled at all
(durability: none), including for the metadata tables. Such users are already
risking data loss when a server fails, but are not subject to any additional
risk from these bugs, which occur during automated recovery from such failures.

## Some WAL recovery files were not being properly cleaned up

A less serious bug than the above critical bugs was discovered and fixed,
pertaining to write-ahead log recovery. This bug involved recovery files not
being removed properly when no longer required and was fixed in [#432].
