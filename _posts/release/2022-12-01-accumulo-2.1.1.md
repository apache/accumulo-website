** DRAFT RELEASE NOTES **

## About

Apache Accumulo 2.1.1 is a patch release of the 2.1.0 LTM line. 

### Major Improvements

### Minor Improvements

* {% ghi 3077 %}, {% ghi 3079 %} Avoid filling OS file caches by setting the
  `FSDataOutputStream.setDropBehind` flag when performing likely one-time file
  accesses, as with WAL files and major compaction input files. This should allow
  files that might benefit more from caching to stay in the cache longer.
* {% ghi 3023 %} Prevent excessive logging when an ExternalCompaction is cancelled for cause

### Behavior Changes

* {% ghi 3082 %} ScanServers can now scan offline tables. The AccumuloClient will no longer
  throw a TableOfflineException when creating a Scanner or BatchScanner against an offline table.
  Instead, an error will be thrown on the call to iterator().

### Bug Fixes

* {% ghi 3059 %} Remove stale compactions from CompactionCoordinator internal structure
* {% ghi 3057 %} Modified Monitor to direct DataTable errors to console
* {% ghi 3053 %} Reduce amount of thread pool logging
* {% ghi 3048 %} Shorten time strings in Monitor
