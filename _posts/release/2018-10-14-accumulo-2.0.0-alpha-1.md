Apache Accumulo 2.0.0-alpha-1 contains numerous changes since the 1.9. This
alpha release is a preview of features coming in 2.0.0. It is being made
available for preview, testing, and evaluation of those upcoming features, but
is *not yet suitable for production use*. API, packaging, and other changes may
still occur before a final 2.0.0 release.

* [User Manual][user_manual] - In-depth developer and administrator documentation
* [Javadocs][javadoc] - Accumulo 2.0 API (subject to change)

## Notable Changes

* Please see the [draft release notes for 2.0.0][draft_notes] for a list of the
  changes coming in 2.0.0, many of which are either complete, or nearly
  complete in this alpha release.
