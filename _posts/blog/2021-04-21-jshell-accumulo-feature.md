Title: JShell Accumulo Feature

---

## Overview

First introduced in Java 9, [JShell][jshell-doc] is an interactive Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL) 
Java tool that interprets user's input and outputs the results. This tool provides a convenient 
way to test out and execute quick tasks with Accumulo in the terminal. This feature is a part 
of the upcoming Accumulo 2.1 release. If you're a developer and want to get involved in testing, 
[contact us][contact] or review our [contributing guide][guide].

## Major Features
* Default JShell script provides initial imports for interacting with Accumulo's API and 
provided in Accumulo's binary distribution tarball


* On startup, JShell Accumulo  will automatically import the `CLASSPATH`, load in a configured 
environment from user's `conf/accumulo-env.sh`, and invoke `conf/jshell-init.jsh` 
to allow rapid Accumulo task executions


* JShell Accumulo can startup using default/custom JShell script and users can append any JShell 
command-line [options][jshell-option] to the startup command

## Booting Up JShell Accumulo
1) Open up a terminal and navigate to Accumulo's installation directory 

2) To startup JShell with **default script** use this command:

```bash
$ bin/accumulo jshell 
```
3) To startup JShell with **custom script** use this command:

```bash
$ bin/accumulo jshell --startup file/path/to/custom_script.jsh
```
**Note:** One can execute the `jshell` command to startup JShell. However, doing so will require 
manually importing the `CLASSPATH` and the configured environment from `conf/accumulo-env.sh` 
and manually specifying the startup file for `conf/jshell-init.jsh` before any Accumulo tasks 
can be performed. Using one of the startup commands above will automate that process 
for convenience. 
 

## JShell Accumulo Default Script
The auto-generated `jshell-init.jsh` is a customizable file located in Accumulo's installation 
`conf/` directory. Inside, `jshell-init.jsh` contains [Accumulo Java APIs][public APIs] 
formatted as import statements and [AccumuloClient][client] build implementation. On startup, 
the script automatically loads in the APIs and attempts to construct a client. Should additional 
APIs and/or code implementations be needed, simply append them to `jshell-init.jsh`. 
Alternatively, you can create a separate JShell script and specify the custom script's file path 
on startup.

To construct an [AccumuloClient][client], the provided `conf/jshell-init.jsh` script finds 
and uses `accumulo-client.properties` in Accumulo's class path, and assigns the result 
to a variable called **client**. 

If `accumulo-client.properties` is found, a similar result will be produced below:

``` 
Preparing JShell for Apache Accumulo 

Building Accumulo client using 'jar:file:/home/accumulo/lib/accumulo-client.jar!/accumulo-client.properties'

Use 'client' to interact with Accumulo

|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 11.0.10
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> 
```

If `accumulo-client.properties` is not found, an [AccumuloClient][client] will not 
auto-generate and will produce the following result below:

```
Preparing JShell for Apache Accumulo 

'accumulo-client.properties' was not found on the classpath

|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 11.0.10
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> 
```

## JShell Accumulo Example
1) Booting up JShell Accumulo using default script

```
Preparing JShell for Apache Accumulo 

Building Accumulo client using 'file:/home/accumulo/conf/accumulo-client.properties'

Use 'client' to interact with Accumulo

|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 11.0.10
|  For an introduction type: /help intro

jshell> 
```

2) Providing JShell with an Accumulo task

```Java
  // Create a table called "GothamPD".
  client.tableOperations().create("GothamPD");

  // Create a Mutation object to hold all changes to a row in a table. 
  // Each row has a unique row ID.
  Mutation mutation = new Mutation("id0001");

  // Create key/value pairs for Batman. Put them in the "hero" family.
  mutation.put("hero", "alias", "Batman");
  mutation.put("hero", "name", "Bruce Wayne");
  mutation.put("hero", "wearsCape?", "true");

  // Create a BatchWriter to the GothamPD table and add your mutation to it. 
  // Try w/ resources will close for us.
  try (BatchWriter writer = client.createBatchWriter("GothamPD")) {
      writer.addMutation(mutation);
  }
  
  // Read and print all rows of the "GothamPD" table. 
  // Try w/ resources will close for us.
  try (ScannerBase scan = client.createScanner("GothamPD", Authorizations.EMPTY)) {
    System.out.println("Gotham Police Department Persons of Interest:");
    
    // A Scanner is an extension of java.lang.Iterable so behaves just like one.
    scan.forEach((k, v) -> System.out.printf("Key : %-50s Value : %s\n", k, v));
  }
```

**Note:** The fully-qualified class name for Accumulo Scanner or 
`org.apache.accumulo.core.client.Scanner` needs to be used due to conflicting issues with 
Java's built-in java.util.Scanner. However, to shorten the Accumulo Scanner's declaration, assign 
scan to `ScannerBase` type instead.  

3) Executing the Accumulo task above outputs:

```
mutation ==> org.apache.accumulo.core.data.Mutation@1
Gotham Police Department Persons of Interest:
Key : id0001 hero:alias [] 1618926204602 false            Value : Batman
Key : id0001 hero:name [] 1618926204602 false             Value : Bruce Wayne
Key : id0001 hero:wearsCape? [] 1618926204602 false       Value : true
