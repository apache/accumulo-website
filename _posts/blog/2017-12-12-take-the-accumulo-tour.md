title: "Take the Accumulo Tour!"
---

Apache Accumulo now has a [hands-on tour][tour] that introduces users to key Accumulo concepts
by completing a series of programming exercises. Don't worry! Solutions are provided if
you get stuck.

The tour has a [getting started][gs] page that helps you set up your development environment and
clone a repository with template code. After you are set up, the tour has exercises that cover the
following Accumulo concepts:

 * [Writing and Reading from Accumulo](/tour/basic-read-write/)
 * [Data Model](/tour/data-model/)
 * [Authorizations](/tour/authorizations/)
 * [Ranges & Splits](/tour/ranges-splits/)
 * [Batch Scanner](/tour/batch-scanner/)
 * [Conditional Writer](/tour/conditional-writer/)

More exercises (such as one on Accumulo Iterators) will be added in the future so check for updates.
