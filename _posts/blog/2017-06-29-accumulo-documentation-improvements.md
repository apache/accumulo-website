title: "Documentation Improvements for 2.0"
author: Mike Walch

Since Accumulo 1.7, the [Accumulo user manual][manual] source resided in the [source repository][accumulo-repo] as asciidoc. For every release or update to the manual,
an HTML document is produced from the asciidoc, committed to the [project website repository][website-repo], and published to the website. This process will remain
for 1.x releases.

For 2.0, the source for the user manual was converted to markdown and moved to the [website repository][website-repo]. The
[upcoming 2.0 documentation][docs-2.0] has several improvements over the older documentation:

* Improved navigation using a new sidebar
* Changes to the documentation are now immediately viewable on the website
* Better linking to Javadocs and between documentation pages
* Documentation style now matches the website

While the [2.0 documentation][docs-2.0] is viewable, it is not linked to (except by this post) and every page contains a warning that the documentation
is for a future release. Each page also links to the documentation for the latest release.


and submit a pull request to the [website repository][website-repo]. A committer will review your changes so don't be afraid to contribute!
